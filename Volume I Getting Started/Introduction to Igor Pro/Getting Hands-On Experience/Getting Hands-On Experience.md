Learning Igor
To harness the power of Igor, you need to understand its fundamental concepts. Some of these concepts are 
familiar to you. However, Igor also incorporates a few concepts that will be new to you and may seem 
strange at first. The most important of these are waves and experiments.
In addition to this introduction, the primary resources for learning Igor are:
•
The Guided Tour of Igor Pro in Chapter I-2
The guided tour shows you how to perform basic Igor tasks step-by-step and reinforces your under-
standing of basic Igor concepts along the way.
The guided tour provides an essential orientation to Igor and is highly-recommended for all Igor users.
•
The Igor Pro PDF manual and online help files
You can access the PDF manual through Igor's Help menu or by opening it directly from the Manual 
folder of the Igor Pro Folder where Igor is installed.
You can access the help files through the Igor Help Browser (choose HelpIgor Help Browser) or 
directly through the HelpHelp Windows submenu.
•
The example experiments
The example experiments illustrate a wide range of Igor features. They are stored in the Examples 
folder in the Igor Pro Folder. You can access them using the FileExample Experiments submenu 
or directly from the Examples folder of the Igor Pro Folder where Igor is installed.
You will best learn Igor through a combination of doing the guided tour, reading select parts of the manual 
(see suggestions following the guided tour), and working with your own data.
Videos of the guided tour are available at:
