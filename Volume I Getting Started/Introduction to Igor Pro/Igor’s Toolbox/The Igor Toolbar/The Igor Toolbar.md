Menus, Dialogs and Commands
Menus and dialogs provide easy access to the most commonly-used Igor operations.
When you choose a menu item associated with an Igor operation, Igor presents a dialog. As you use the 
dialog, Igor generates a command and displays it in the command box near the bottom of the dialog. When 
you click the Do It button, Igor transfers the command to the command line where it is executed.
As you get to know Igor, you will find that some commands are easier to invoke from a dialog and others 
are easier to enter directly in the command line.
There are some menus and dialogs that bypass the command line. Examples are the Save Experiment and 
Open Experiment items in the File menu.
The Igor Toolbar
The main toolbar provides quick access to frequently used features.
On Windows, the default location for the toolbar is just below the main menu bar. On Macintosh, it is at the 
top of the command window.
You can reposition the toolbar by clicking the dots at the left or top edge and dragging. You can either move 
it to a different edge of the outer frame window (Windows) or the command window (Macintosh), or you can 
drag it elsewhere to float the toolbar.
You can hide the toolbar by choosing WindowsHide Toolbar and show it again by choosing Win-
dowsShow Toolbar.
The visibility, position, and orientation of the toolbar is saved when you quit Igor.
Currently it is not possible to change which features are available on the toolbar.
