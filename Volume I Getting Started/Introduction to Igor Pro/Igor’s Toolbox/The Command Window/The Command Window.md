# The Command Window

Chapter I-1 — Introduction to Igor Pro
I-6
Originally XOPs were intended to allow adding operations only to Igor. Now XOPs can add much more, 
including functions, menus, dialogs, and windows, so “XOP” has the meaning “external module that extends 
Igor”.
To create an XOP, you must be a C or C++ programmer and you need the optional Igor External Operations 
Toolkit. See Creating Igor Extensions on page IV-208.
Although creating an extension is a job for a programmer, anyone can use an extension. The Igor installer auto-
matically installs commonly used extensions in "Igor Pro Folder/Igor Extensions (64-bit)". These extensions are 
available for immediate use.
Less commonly used extensions are installed in "Igor Pro Folder/More Extensions (64-bit)". Available extensions 
are described in the “XOP Index” help file (choose HelpHelp WindowsXOP Index.ihf). To activate an 
extension, see Activating 64-bit Extensions on page III-512.
Igor’s User Interface 
Igor uses a combination of the familiar graphical user interface and a command-line interface. This 
approach gives Igor both ease-of-use and programmability.
The job of the user interface is to allow you to apply Igor’s operations and functions to objects that you 
create. You can do this in several ways:
•
Via menus and dialogs
•
Using the main toolbar
•
By typing Igor commands directly into the command line
•
By writing Igor procedures
The Command Window 
The command window is Igor’s control center. It appears at the bottom of the screen.
At the bottom of the command window is the command line. Above the red divider is the history area 
where executed commands are stored for review. Igor also uses the history area to report results of analyses 
like curve-fitting or waveform statistics.
You enter commands in the command line.
The name of the current experiment appears as the title of the command window.
When Igor executes a command it transfers it to the history area.
