Chapter I-2 — Guided Tour of Igor Pro
I-64
For Further Exploration
We developed the guided tours in this chapter to provide an overview of the basics of using Igor Pro and 
to give you some experience using features that you will likely need for your day-to-day work. Beyond 
these fundamentals, Igor includes a wide variety of features to facilitate much more advanced graphing and 
analysis of your data.
As you become more familiar with using Igor, you will want to further explore some of the additional learn-
ing and informational aids that we have included with Igor Pro.
•
The Igor Pro manual is installed on your hard disk in PDF format. You can access it through the Igor 
Help Browser or open it directly from the Manual folder in the Igor Pro Folder.
The material in the manual is the same as the material in the online help files but is organized in 
book format and is therefore better suited for linear reading. Unlike the help files, the PDF manual 
includes an index.
The most important chapters at this point in your Igor learning curve are Chapter II-3, Experiments, 
Files and Folders and Chapter II-5, Waves. If you want to learn Igor programming, read Chapter 
IV-1, Working with Commands, Chapter IV-2, Programming Overview, and Chapter IV-3, User-
Defined Functions.
•
The Igor Help Browser provides online help, including reference material for all built-in operations, 
functions, and keywords, an extensive list of shortcuts, and the ability to search Igor help files, pro-
cedure files, examples and technical notes for key phrases. See The Igor Help Browser on page II-2 
for more information.
•
The Examples folder contains a wide variety of sample experiments illustrating many of Igor’s 
advanced graphing and programming facilities. You can access these most easily through the 
FileExample Experiments submenus.
•
The Learning Aids folder contains additional guided tours and tutorials including a tutorial on 
image processing. You can access these through the FileExample ExperimentsTutorials sub-
menus.
•
A tutorial on 3D visualization can be found in the “3D Graphics” help window, accessible through 
the HelpHelp Windows menu.
•
The WaveMetrics Procedures folder contains a number of utility procedures that you may find 
useful for writing your own procedures and for your more advanced graphing requirements. For 
an overview of the WaveMetrics procedures and easy loading of the procedure files, choose 
HelpHelp WindowsWM Procedures Index.
•
The “More Extensions (64-bit)” folder contains a number of External Operations (XOPs), which add 
functionality not built into the Igor Pro application. Read the included help files to find out more 
about the individual XOPs and how to install them, or consult the External Operations Index in the 
XOP Index help file, which has brief description of each XOP.
•
The Technical Notes folder contains additional information. Tech Note #000 contains an index to all 
of the other notes.
•
The Igor Pro mailing list is an Internet mailing list where Igor users share ideas and help each other. 
See Igor Mailing List on page II-4 or select the HelpSupport menu and then select Igor Mailing 
List from the Support Options list for information about the mailing list.
•
IgorExchange is a user-to-user support web page and a repository for user-created Igor Pro projects.
