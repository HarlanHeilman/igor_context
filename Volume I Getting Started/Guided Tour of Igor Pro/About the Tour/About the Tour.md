# About the Tour

Chapter I-2 — Guided Tour of Igor Pro
I-12
Overview
In this chapter we take a look at the main functions of Igor Pro by stepping through some typical operations. 
Our goal is to orient you so that you can comfortably read the rest of the manual or explore the program on 
your own. You will benefit most from this tour if you actually do the instructed operations on your com-
puter as you read this chapter. Screen shots are provided to keep you synchronized with the tour.
Terminology
If you have read Chapter I-1, Introduction to Igor Pro, you already know these terms.
About the Tour
This tour consists of three sections: Guided Tour 1 - General Tour on page I-13, Guided Tour 2 - Data Anal-
ysis on page I-46, and Guided Tour 3 - Histograms and Curve Fitting on page I-53.
The General Tour is a rambling exploration intended to introduce you to the way things work in Igor and give 
you a general orientation.
The second and third tours guide you through Igor’s data analysis facilities including simple curve fitting.
When you’ve completed the first tour you may prefer to explore freely on your own before starting the sec-
ond tour.
Experiment
The entire collection of data, graphs and other windows, program text 
and other data that make up the current Igor environment or workspace.
Wave
Short for waveform, this is basically a named array of data with optional 
extra information.
Name
Because Igor contains a built-in programming and data transformation 
language, each object must have a unique name.
Command
This is a line of text that performs some task. Igor is command-driven so 
that it can be easily programmed.
