Fitting to a Subrange
Here we will again fit our data to a Gaussian but using a subset of the data. We will then extrapolate the fit 
outside of the initial range.
1.
Choose the GraphShow Info menu item.
A cursor info panel is appended to the bottom of the graph.
Two cursors are "docked" in the info panel, Cursor A and Cursor B.
2.
Place cursor A (the round one) on the fakeY trace.
One way to place the cursor is to drag it to the trace. Another way is to control-click (Macintosh) or 
right-click (Windows) on the name area which is just to the right of the cursor icon in the cursor info 
panel.
Note that the cursor A icon in the dock is now black. This indicates that cursor A is selected, meaning 
that it will move if you use the arrow keys on the keyboard or the slider in the cursor info panel.
3.
Move cursor A to point #14.
To move the cursor one point at a time, use the arrow keys on the keyboard or click on either side of 
the slider in the cursor position control.
4.
Click the dock for cursor A in the cursor info panel to deselect it.
This is so you can adjust cursor B without affecting the position of cursor A.
5.
Place cursor B (the square one) on the fakeY trace and move it to point #42.
The graph should look like this:
6.
In the AnalysisQuick Fit menu make sure the Fit Between Cursors item is checked. If it is not, 
select it to check it.
