Overview
There are a number of sources of information for learning about Igor Pro. The most important are:

The Guided Tour

The Igor help system
•
The Igor Pro online manual
•
The example experiments in the Examples folder
•
The Igor mailing list
•
The IgorExchange user-to-user support web page
The Guided Tour
The Igor guided tour is indispensible for learning Igor.
The time you spend doing the guided tour will be repaid many times over in productivity. To do the guided 
tour, choose HelpGetting Started.
The same material is available in the first two chapters of this manual: Introduction to Igor Pro on page I-1 and 
Guided Tour of Igor Pro on page I-11.
Online Manual
The Igor Pro installer installs the entire Igor Pro manual as an Adobe PDF file. The PDF manual contains the 
same information as the online help files but in the more familiar PDF format.
You can open the manual by choosing HelpManual or by double-clicking the IgorMan.pdf file in “Igor Pro-
Folder/Manual”.
The manual is not available in hard-copy form.
Online Help
Igor's online help system consists of these components:
•
The Igor help browser
•
Igor help files
•
Tooltips
The Igor Help Browser
The Igor Help Browser is designed to provide quick access to the most frequently-used Igor reference mate-
rial and also to provide a starting point in searching for other kinds of information. You can display the Igor 
Help Browser by:
• Choosing HelpIgor Help Browser
• Pressing the help key (Macintosh only)
• Pressing the F1 key (Windows only)
• Clicking the question-mark icon in the lower/right corner of the command window
