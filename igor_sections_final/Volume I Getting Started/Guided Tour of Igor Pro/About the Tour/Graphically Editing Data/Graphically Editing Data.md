14.
Click the Manual tab and then click the Open Online Manual button.
Igor opens the PDF manual in your PDF viewer - typically Adobe Reader or Apple's Preview pro-
gram.
If you use Adobe Reader for viewing PDF files, you should have a Bookmarks pane on the left side of 
the PDF manual window. If not, choose ViewShow/HideNavigation PanesBookmarks in 
Reader.
If you use Apple's Preview for PDF files, you should have a sidebar displaying the table of contents 
on one side of the main page. If not, choose ViewTable of Contents in Preview.
Note in the Reader Bookmarks pane or the Preview table of contents that the PDF manual is organized 
into five volumes plus an index.
15.
Use the bookmarks or table of contents to get a sense of what's in the manual.
Expand the volume bookmarks to see the chapter names.
You may notice that the Igor PDF manual is rather large - over 2,000 pages at last count. You'll be 
happy to know that we don't expect you to read it cover-to-cover. Instead, read chapters as the need 
arises.
The information in the manual is also in the online help files. The manual, being in book format, is 
better organized for linear reading while the online help is usually preferred for accessing reference 
information.
In case you ever want to open it directly, you can find the PDF manual in "Igor Pro Folder/Manual".
That should give you an idea of where to look for information about Igor. Now let's get back to our hands-
on exploration of Igor.
