# Igor Pro Programming Language Documentation

> Comprehensive context library for programming in Igor Pro, providing LLMs with access to official documentation, procedure examples, and help files. This project serves as a structured knowledge base for Igor Pro programming language, enabling accurate code generation and technical assistance.

This repository contains the complete Igor Pro documentation organized for LLM context retrieval. Igor Pro is an interactive software environment developed by WaveMetrics for scientists and engineers, used for technical graphing, data analysis, and image processing. It features waves (multidimensional arrays up to 4D), a compiled C-like programming language, and extensive capabilities for data visualization and analysis.
