Using Cursors
1.
If you are returning from a break, open your “Tour 1C.pxp” experiment and turn preferences off.
2.
Click in the graph and choose the GraphShow Info menu item.
A cursor info panel appears below the graph.
3.
Control-click (Macintosh) or right-click (Windows) in the name area for graph cursor A (the round 
one), where it says “A:”.
4.
Choose “spiralY” from the pop-up menu.
The A cursor is placed on point zero of spiralY.
5.
Repeat for cursor B but choose “spiralY#1” from the pop-up menu.
The wave spiralY is graphed twice. The #1 suffix is used to distinguish the second instance from the first. 
It is #1 rather than #2 because in Igor indices start from zero.
6.
Position the mouse pointer over the center of the cursor position control 
.
7.
Click the blue slider and gently drag it to the right.
Both cursors move to increasing point numbers. They stop when one or both get to the end.
You can also move the cursors using the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard or by clicking to 
the left or right of the blue slider.
8.
Practice moving the slider to the left and right.
Notice that the cursors move with increasing speed as the slider is displaced farther from the center.
