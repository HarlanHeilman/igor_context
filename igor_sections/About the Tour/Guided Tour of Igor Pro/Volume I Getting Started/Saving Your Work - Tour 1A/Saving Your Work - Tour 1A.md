Saving Your Work - Tour 1A
In this section, we will create a “Guided Tours” folder in which to save our work so far. Then we will save 
the current experiment in an Igor experiment file.
You can save Igor files anywhere. Here will will create the “Guided Tours” folder in the “Igor Pro User 
Files” folder. Igor creates “Igor Pro User Files” when it first starts. It is a good place to save Igor files.
1.
Choose HelpShow Igor Pro User Files.
Igor opens the "Igor Pro User Files" folder on the desktop.
By default, this folder has the Igor Pro major version number in its name, for example, "Igor Pro 9 User 
Files", but it is generically called the "Igor Pro User Files" folder.
Note where in the file system hierarchy this folder is located as you will need to know this in a sub-
sequent step. The default locations are:
Macintosh:
/Users/<user>/Documents/WaveMetrics/Igor Pro 9 User Files
Windows:
C:\Users\<user>\Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 9 User Files
2.
Create a folder named “Guided Tours” in the “Igor Pro User Files” folder.
