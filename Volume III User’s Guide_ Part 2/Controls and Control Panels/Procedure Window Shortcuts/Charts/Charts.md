Using Controls 
The following panel window illustrates most of the control types.
Buttons 
When you click a button, it runs whatever procedure the programmer may have specified.
If nothing happens when you click a button, then there is no procedure assigned to the button. If the pro-
cedure window(s) haven’t been compiled, clicking a button that has an assigned procedure will produce an 
error dialog.
You should choose Compile from the Macros menu to correct this sit-
uation. If no error occurs then the button will now be functional.
Buttons usually have a rounded appearance, but a programmer can 
assign a custom picture so that the button can have nearly any appear-
ance.
Charts
Chart controls can be used to emulate a mechanical chart recorder that writes on paper with moving pens 
as the paper scrolls by under the pens. Charts can be used to monitor data acquisition processes or to 
examine a long data record.
