# Igor TeX References

Chapter III-2 — Annotations
III-60
Although you can use a Greek character such as α (alpha) directly, in order to use the specific font chosen 
for Greek character display, you should still use the \alpha syntax of TeX.
The fonts used in a formula affect not only the visual appearance of characters but also the font embedding 
situation when exporting to the graphics formats Igor PDF and EPSF. See Font Embedding on page III-99 
(Macintosh) and Font Embedding on page III-105 (Windows). When exporting Igor PDF and EPSF with font 
embedding for standard fonts turned off, you should examine the output carefuly and use full font embed-
ding if problems are found.
