Chapter III-2 — Annotations
III-47
If we zoom the graph’s X range to exclude the x=3.75 attachment point, the tag attachment point is offscreen 
but the tag is still drawn:
You can suppress the drawing of a tag whose attachment point is offscreen by choosing “hide the tag” from 
the If Offscreen pop-up menu in the Position Tab.
If you want to see or modify a tag that is hidden, autoscale the graph so that it is no longer hidden.
Contour Labels Are Tags
Igor uses specialized tags to create the numerical labels for contour plots. The specialization adds a "tan-
gent" feature to automatically orient the tag along the path of the contour lines. See Contour Labels on page 
II-377 for details.
Color Scales
A color scale annotation summarizes the range of data using a color bar and one or more axes.
