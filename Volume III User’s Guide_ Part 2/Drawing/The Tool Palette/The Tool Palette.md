# The Tool Palette

Chapter III-3 — Drawing
III-62
Overview
Igor’s drawing tools are useful in page layout and graph windows for highlighting material with boxes, 
circles and arrows and can also be used to create simple diagrams. These drawing tools are object-oriented 
and optimized for the creation of publication quality graphics.
You can graphically edit a wave’s data values when it is displayed in a graph; data points can be deleted, 
added or modified. You can also create new waves by simply drawing them.
In control panel windows, you can use the drawing tools to create a fancy background for controls.
Like all other aspects of Igor, drawing tools are fully programmable. This allows programmers to create 
packages of code that add new graph types to Igor’s repertoire. Although only programmers can create 
such packages, everyone can make use of them.
The drawing tools are available only in page layout, graph and control panel windows.
The Tool Palette
To use the drawing tools you first need to invoke the tool palette. In graphs and control panels this is done 
by the Show Tools menu command in the Graph or Panel menu. This command adds a tool palette along 
the left edge of the window. The tool palette is always available in page layout windows.
With the exception of Undo, Cut, Copy, Clear, Paste, Select All and Duplicate in the Edit menu, all drawing 
commands are located in the tool palette.
Once displayed, the tool palette works in two modes:
•
Operate mode: Click the top (operate) button to enter Operate mode. In this mode, the drawing tool 
palette is not available, and you interact with the window as normal.
•
Drawing mode: Click the second (drawing) button to enter Drawing mode. The entire tool palette 
will then be displayed, and you can add text, arrows, boxes, and other shapes to the window.
The three bottom icons in the tool palette — the Drawing Environment icon (tree and grass), Drawing Layer 
icon, and the Mover icon (bulldozer) — are pop-up menus. If you press Option (Macintosh) or Alt (Windows) 
while clicking the Mover icon, you get a pop-up menu that allows you to retrieve offscreen drawing ele-
ments, if any.
The icons above, with the triangle symbol, when clicked, select a mode of operation for creating various 
shapes using the mouse. If you click them and hold, they present pop-up menus that allow you to invoke 
dialogs for creating the shapes.
