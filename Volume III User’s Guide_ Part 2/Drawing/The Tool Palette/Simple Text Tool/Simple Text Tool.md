Arrow Tool
Use the arrow tool to select, move and resize one or more drawing objects or user-defined controls.
Selecting, Moving, and Resizing Objects
Click a drawing object once to select it. When selected, small squares called handles appear, defining the 
object’s size. You can drag these handles to resize single or multiple objects. By pressing Shift while clicking 
a handle, an object resize can be constrained to the horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions depending on 
how close the cursor is to these directions. By pressing Option (Macintosh) or Alt (Windows) instead, the 
resize is constrained to entirely horizontal or entirely vertical, depending on the position of the cursor.
If you click an object and it does not become selected then the object may be in a different drawing layer or 
it may not in fact be a drawing object at all.
You can select multiple drawing objects by shift clicking additional objects. You can remove an object from 
a selection by shift clicking a selected object.
You can also select multiple drawing objects by dragging a selection rectangle around a set of drawing 
objects. Unless you first press Option (Macintosh) or Alt (Windows), only objects that are completely 
enclosed by the selection rectangle are included in the selection. With Option (Macintosh) or Alt (Windows) 
pressed, objects that are merely touched by the selection rectangle are included. You can append additional 
objects to a selection by pressing Shift before dragging out a selection rectangle.
You can select all objects in the current layer with the Select All item in the Edit menu.
Rotating Objects
You can rotate draw objects by clicking just beyond a selection's visible resizing handles.
When the mouse is over an invisible rotation handle, the cursor changes shape, indicating that you can 
rotate the object. Click and drag the invisible rotation handle to rotate it.
Duplicating Objects
You can duplicate selected drawing objects using the Duplicate command found in the Edit menu. If, right 
after duplicating an object, you reposition the duplicated object and duplicate again then the new object will 
be offset from the last by the amount you just defined.
Deleting Objects
You can delete selected drawing objects by pressing Delete.
Modifying Objects
Double-clicking a drawing object displays a dialog for that object. You can then change any of the settings 
available in the dialog. Click the Do it button to apply the changes.
Simple Text Tool
The text tool is usually used to create a single line of simple text with the same font, size, style and rotation. 
You can also create formatted text using multiple lines and all the escape codes supported by annotations 
- see Annotations on page III-33.
The text tool is the only way to add text to control panel windows.
To create a line of text, click the simple text icon. The cursor will change shape to a text entry vertical line. 
Then move the cursor to the location in the window where you want the text origin, and click there to 
invoke the Create Text dialog.
Casual users can ignore the Anchor pop-up menu. It is used mainly by programmers to ensure that text is 
aligned properly about the numeric origin (X0,Y0). Any rotation is applied first and then the rotated text is 
aligned relative to the origin as specified by the anchor setting.
To edit or change a text object, double-click the object with the Arrow tool.
