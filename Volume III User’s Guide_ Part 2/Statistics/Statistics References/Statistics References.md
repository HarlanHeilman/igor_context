Statistics Procedures
Several procedure files are provided to extend the built-in statistics capability described in this chapter. 
Some of these procedure files provide user interfaces to the built-in statistics functionality. Others extend 
the functionality.
In the Analysis menu you will find a Statistics item that brings up a submenu. Selecting any item in the 
submenu will cause all the statistics-related procedure files to be loaded, making them ready to use. Alter-
natively, you can load all the statistics procedures by adding the following include statement to the top of 
your procedure window:
#include <AllStatsProcedures>
Functionality provided by the statistics procedure files includes the 1D Statistics Report package for auto-
matic analysis of single 1D waves, and the ANOVA Power Calculations Panel, as well as functions to create 
specialized graphs:
Also included are these convenience functions:
