In this example, the gray lines are governed by the HTMLCode ruler. Igor writes the text in these line 
directly to the HTML file. This example produces a numbered list, called an “ordered list”, which is 
announced using the HTML “OL” tag.
By convention, we make the ruler font color for the HTMLCode ruler gray. This allows us to distinguish at 
a glance the HTML code from the normal notebook text. The use of the color gray is merely a convention. 
It is the fact that the ruler is named HTMLCode that makes Igor write the contents of these paragraphs 
directly to the HTML file.
Here is an example that shows how to create a simple table:
<TABLE border="1" summary="Example of creating a table in HTML.">
<CAPTION><EM>A Simple Table</EM></CAPTION>
<TR><TH><TH>Col 1<TH>Col 2<TH>Col 3
<TR><TH>Row 1<TD>10<TD>20<TD>30
<TR><TH>Row 2<TD>40<TD>50<TD>60
</TABLE>
Here is an example that includes a link:
