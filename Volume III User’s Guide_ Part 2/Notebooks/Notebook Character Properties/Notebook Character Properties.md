Plain Notebook Paragraph Properties
For each plain notebook, there is one set of paragraph properties that govern all paragraphs. Many of the 
items are fixed — you can’t adjust them.
There is only one font, text size, text style and text color for the entire document which you can set using 
the Notebook menu.
Although you can not set paragraph tab stops in a plain notebook, you can set and use the notebook’s 
default tab stops, which affect the entire notebook.
Notebook Character Properties
The character properties are font, text size, text style, text color and vertical offset. The vertical offset is used 
mainly to implement superscript and subscript. A specific collection of character properties is called a “text 
format”. You can set the text format using the Notebook menu. The Set Text Format dialog allows you to 
inspect and set all of the character properties.
