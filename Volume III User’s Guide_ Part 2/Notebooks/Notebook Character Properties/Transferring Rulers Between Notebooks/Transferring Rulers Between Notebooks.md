# Transferring Rulers Between Notebooks

Chapter III-1 — Notebooks
III-12
In a sophisticated word processor, a ruler can be based on another ruler so that changing the first ruler auto-
matically changes the second. Igor rulers do not have this capability.
Redefining a Ruler
When you redefine a ruler, all paragraphs governed by the ruler are automatically updated. There are three 
principal ways to redefine a ruler:
•
Use the Redefine Ruler dialog.
•
Use the Ruler Font, Ruler Text Size, Ruler Text Style or Ruler Text Color pop-up menu items.
•
Use the Redefine Ruler from Selection item in the Ruler pop-up menu.
•
Press the Command key (Macintosh) or Ctrl key (Windows) while using a margin, indent, tab, align-
ment, or spacing control in the ruler bar.
To invoke the Redefine Ruler dialog, choose Redefine Ruler from the Ruler pop-up menu.
Another handy way to redefine an existing ruler (e.g. Normal) is to adjust it, creating a derived ruler (e.g. 
Normal+). Then choose Redefine Ruler from Selection from the Ruler pop-up menu. This redefines the 
explicitly named ruler (Normal) to match the current ruler (Normal+).
Creating a Derived Ruler
You can adjust a ruler using its icons. When you do this, you create a derived ruler. A derived ruler is usually 
a minor variation of an explicitly created ruler.
If you redefine the Normal ruler, the Normal+ ruler is not automatically redefined. This is a limitation in 
Igor’s implementation of rulers compared to a word-processor program.
Finding Where a Ruler Is Used
You can find the next or previous paragraph governed by a particular ruler. To do this press Option (Mac-
intosh) or Alt (Windows) while selecting the name of the ruler from the Ruler pop-up menu. To search back-
wards, press Shift-Option (Macintosh) or Shift+Alt (Windows) while selecting the ruler. If there is no next or 
previous use of the ruler, Igor will emit a beep.
Removing a Ruler
Rulers that you no longer need clutter up the Ruler pop-up menu. You can remove them from the document 
by choosing Remove Ruler from the Ruler pop-up menu.
You might want to know if a particular ruler is used in the document. The only way to do this is to search 
for the ruler. See Finding Where a Ruler Is Used on page III-12.
Transferring Rulers Between Notebooks
The only way to transfer a ruler from one notebook to another is by copying text from the first notebook 
and pasting it in the second. Rulers needed for the text are also copied and pasted. If a ruler that exists in 
the source notebook also exists in the destination, the destination ruler takes precedence.
If you expect to create a lot of notebooks that share the same rulers then you should create a template doc-
ument with the common rulers. See Notebook Template Files on page III-30 for details.
