Parts of a Notebook
This illustration shows the parts of a formatted notebook window. A plain notebook window has the same 
parts except for the ruler.
Ruler Bar
Rulers defined paragraph formatting, including font, text size, text style, indents, tabs, and spacing.
You can use the ruler bar to apply a ruler to the selected paragraphs, to modify a ruler, or to apply changes 
to the selected text without changing the current ruler.
In a formatted text notebook, you can show and hide the ruler bar using the Notebook menu. You can not 
show the ruler bar in a plain text notebook.
You can create as many rulers as you want in a formatted text notebook. A plain text notebook has just one 
ruler.
Document Info Icon
The icon in the bottom/left corner of the notebook is the document info icon. When you click it, Igor displays 
information about the notebook and its associated file, if any.
Write-Protect Icon
Notebooks (as well as procedure windows) have a write-enable/write-protect icon which appears in the 
lower-left corner of the window and resembles a pencil. If you click this icon, Igor Pro will draw a line through 
the pencil, indicating that the notebook is write-protected. The main purpose of this is to prevent accidental 
manual alteration of shared procedure files, but you can also use it to prevent accidental manual alteration of 
notebooks.
Note that write-protect is not the same as read-only. Write-protect prevents manual modifications while 
read-only prevents all modifications. See Notebook Read/Write Properties on page III-10 for details.
Magnifier Icon
You can magnify procedure text to make it more readable. See Text Magnification on page II-53 for details.
