Notebook Properties
Everything in a notebook that you can control falls into one of four categories, as shown in this table.
Notebook Document Properties
To set document properties, choose NotebookDocument Settings. These are properties that apply to the 
notebook as a whole, such as page margins, headers, footers, background color, and default tab stops.
The next illustration shows the effects of the page margins and header and footer position settings. In addi-
tion, these settings affect the Rich Text format file which you can use to export a notebook to a word processor.
The notebook page margins override margins set via the Page Setup dialog and the PrintSettings operation 
margins keyword.
Notebook Default Tabs
The default tab width setting controls the location of all tab stops in plain text notebooks and of all tab stops 
after the last explicit tab stop in formatted notebooks. You set this using the Document Settings dialog in 
the Notebook menu or using the Notebook operation defaultTab or defaultTab2 keywords.
