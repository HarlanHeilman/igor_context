Chapter III-1 — Notebooks
III-20
In a formatted notebook, you can insert a manual page break using the Insert Page Break item in the Edit 
menu. Igor displays a manual page break as a dashed line across the notebook window. You can’t insert a 
manual page break into a plain notebook.
There is no way to see where Igor will put automatic page breaks other than by printing the document or 
using the Print Preview feature.
Headers and Footers
Both formatted and plain notebooks can have headers or footers.
You create headers and footers using the Document Settings dialog.
The header position is specified as a distance from the top of the paper. The footer position is specified as a 
distance from the bottom of the paper. The units are your preferred units as specified in the Miscellaneous 
section of the Miscellaneous Settings dialog.
For most uses, the default header or default footer will be sufficient. The default header consists of the date, 
window title and page number. The other options are intended for use in fancy reports.
Clicking Edit Header or Edit Footer displays a subdialog in which you can enter text as well as special char-
acters.
The Page Number and Number of Pages special characters are displayed on the screen as # characters but 
are printed using the actual page number and number of pages in the document. The Date, Time and 
Window Title special characters are automatically updated when the document is printed.
Header and footer settings are saved in formatted notebook files but not in plain text notebook files. Con-
sequently, settings for plain text notebook files revert to preferred settings, as set by the Capture Notebook 
Prefs dialog, when you open a file as a plain text notebook.
Printing Notebooks
To print an entire notebook, click so that no text is selected and then choose FilePrint Notebook Window.
To print part of a notebook, select the section that you want to print and then choose FilePrint Notebook 
Selection.

The Rich Text Format (RTF) is a file format created by Microsoft Corporation for exchanging formatted text 
documents between programs. Microsoft also calls it the Interchange format. Many word processors can 
import and export RTF.
