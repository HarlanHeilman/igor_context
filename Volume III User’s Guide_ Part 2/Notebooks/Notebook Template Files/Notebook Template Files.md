You will need to replace “putGraphicNameHere” with the name of a picture. Use the Pictures dialog, via 
the Misc menu, to see what named pictures are stored in the current experiment or to add a named picture. 
See Pictures on page III-509 for more information.
There is a shortcut that generates commands without going through the dialog. Select some text in the note-
book, press Option (Macintosh) or Alt (Windows) and choose Copy from the Edit menu. This generates com-
mands for the selected text and text formats. Press the Shift-Option (Macintosh) or Shift+Alt (Windows) to 
also generate document and ruler commands.
Notebook Preferences
The notebook preferences affect the creation of new notebooks. There is one set of preferences for plain note-
books and another set of preferences for formatted notebooks.
To set notebook preferences, set the attributes of any notebook of the desired type (plain or formatted) and 
then use the Capture Notebook Prefs item in the Notebook menu.
To determine what the preference settings are you must create a new notebook and examine its settings.
Notebook windows each have their own Page Setup values. New notebook windows will have their own 
copy of the captured Page Setup values.
Preferences are stored in the Igor Preferences file. See Chapter III-18, Preferences, for further information 
on preferences.
Notebook Template Files
A template notebook provides a way to customize the initial contents of a new notebook. When you open 
a template notebook, Igor opens it normally but leaves it untitled and disassociates it from the template 
notebook file. This leaves you with a new notebook based on your prototype. When you save the untitled 
notebook, Igor creates a new notebook file.
Template notebooks have ".ift" as the file name extension instead of ".ifn". 
To make a template notebook, start by creating a prototype formatted text notebook with whatever contents 
you would like in a new notebook.
Choose FileSave Notebook As, choose IGOR Formatted Notebook Template from the file type pop-up 
menu, and save the template notebook.
You can convert an existing formatted text notebook file into a template file by changing the extension from 
".ifn" to ".ift".
The Macintosh Finder’s file info window has a Stationery Pad checkbox. Checking it turns a file into a sta-
tionery pad. When you double-click a stationery pad file, Mac OS X creates a copy of the file and opens the 
copy. For most uses, the template technique is more convenient.
