# Choosing Number of Coefficients for FIR Designs

Chapter III-9 — Signal Processing

Choosing FIR Band Frequencies
You can avoid reducing the amplitude of frequencies near the end of the pass band by increasing the End 
of Pass Band frequency. A larger number of cofficients may be needed.
Choosing Number of Coefficients for FIR Designs
You can obtain a steeper transition from the pass band to the reject band by increasing the number of coef-
ficients.
