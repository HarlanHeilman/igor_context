What does dB mean?
dB, an abbreviation for "decibel", is a logarithmic unit used to express the ratio of one value to another. In 
filtering it is the ratio of the output amplitude to the input amplitude at a given frequency. 0 dB means no 
change in ratio and is the response of a filter in the pass band.
dB is computed as 20 * log(ratio) where ratio is output amplitude divided by input amplitude. So -100dB 
means a ratio of 10-5 or 0.00001. You can see this by switching the response from dB to Gain and expanding 
the range vertically quite a lot:
