You can position the subwindow by clicking on its heavy frame to enter subwindow layout mode (see Sub-
window Layout Mode and Guides on page III-85). Finally, click the top icon of the tools to adjust the 
graphs in operate mode.
Positioning and Guides
Subwindows can be positioned in their hosts in a wide variety of ways. You can specify the position of a 
subwindow numerically using either absolute (fixed distance) or relative modes. You can also attach key 
locations in a subwindow to named guides.
Guides are horizontal or vertical reference locations defined by the immediate host of a subwindow and 
may be either fixed (built-in) or moveable (user-defined). Built-in guides represent fixed locations of the 
host such as its frame or the interior plot area of graphs. Built-in guides can not be moved except by moving 
the object to which the guide refers.
All host windows have built-in guides named FL, FT, FR, and FB for Frame Left, Frame Top, Frame Right, 
and Frame Bottom. Graphs also have the corresponding PL, PR, PT, and PB for the interior plot area. In 
addition, base graphs have built-in guides GL, GR, GT, and GB for the graph area.
