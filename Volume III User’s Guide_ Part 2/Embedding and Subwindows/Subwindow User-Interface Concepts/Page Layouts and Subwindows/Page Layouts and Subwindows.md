# Page Layouts and Subwindows

Graph Control Bars and Subpanels
A control bar is a control panel subwindow attached to an edge of a graph.
You can drag out control bar areas from all four sides of a graph window.You do this by entering drawing 
mode, clicking just inside an outer edge of the window, and dragging toward the center of the window. 
This creates a subpanel and anchors it to appropriate guides.
Page Layouts and Subwindows
Subwindows in page layouts windows can be a bit confusing because you use two different modes to posi-
tion conventional graph and table objects versus subwindows. In the normal mode for a page layout (top 
icon in the tool palette), you can adjust the positioning of conventional layout objects but not subwindows 
because they are in operate mode.
In operate mode, subwindow graphs act just like conventional graph windows and allow marquee expan-
sion, double clicking on graph elements to bring up dialogs, dragging textboxes and axes and other normal 
graph behavior. But to adjust the position of subwindows, you have to enter subwindow layout (see Sub-
window Layout Mode and Guides on page III-85).
Although a bit confusing, the use of subwindows in page layouts is very useful because the page layout is then 
self-contained and need not refer to other windows.
Here are a few reasons to use the conventional window or object layout method rather than subwindows:
•
You can use cursors and buttons in a full graph but not in a subgraph.
•
You can place the same graph in multiple layouts.
•
You can have a graph window be a different, and more convenient, size than the layout object.
In a page layout, you can insert a graph subwindow or table by first using the marquee tool to specify the 
desired location and then using the pop-up menu available in the interior of the marquee to choose one of 
several subwindow types. If you need to reposition the new subwindow, you will need to enter drawing 
mode and use the selector (arrow) tool of the drawing tool palette, not the layout arrow tool.
You can convert conventional layout graph and table objects to subwindows via the contextual menu for 
the object. In operate mode (select the top icon in the layout tool palette), Control-click or right-click any-
where on the layout object and choose Convert Graph/Table To Embedded. Portions of a graph that are not 
allowed in layouts, such as buttons and subpanels, are lost in the conversion.
You can convert a subgraph or subtable to a conventional window and layout object via the contextual menu. In 
operate mode, Control-click or right-click and choose Convert To Graph/Table and Object. In a graph you must 
click in an area free of traces or axes, such as in the graph margin, to get the correct popup menu.
