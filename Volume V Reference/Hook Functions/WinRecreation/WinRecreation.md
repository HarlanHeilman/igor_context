WinRecreation
V-1101
Details
index starts from zero, and returns the top-most window matching the parameters.
The window names are ordered in window-stacking order, as returned by WinList.
DoWindow/B moves the window to the back and changes the index needed to retrieve its name to the 
greatest index that returns any name.
Hiding or showing a window (with SetWindow hide=1 or Notebook visible=0 or by manual means) 
does not affect the index associated with the window.
windowTypes is a bitwise parameter:
See Setting Bit Parameters on page IV-12 for details about bit settings.
Examples
Print WinName(0,1)
// Prints the name of the top graph.
Print WinName(0,3)
// Prints the name of the top graph or table.
String win=WinName(0,1)
// The name of the top visible graph.
SetWindow $win hide=1
// Hide the graph (it may already be hidden).
Print WinName(0,1)
// Prints the name of the now-hidden graph.
Print WinName(0,1,1)
// Prints the name of the top visible graph.
Print WinName(0,64,1,1)
// Name of the top visible NewPanel/FLT=1 window.

WinRecreation 
WinRecreation(winStr, options)
The WinRecreation function returns a string containing the window recreation macro (or style macro) for 
the named window.
Parameters
winStr is the name of a graph, table, page layout, panel, notebook, Gizmo, camera, or XOP target window 
or the title of a procedure window or help file. If winStr is "" and options is 0 or 1, information for the top 
graph, table, page layout, panel, notebook, or XOP target window is returned.
As of Igor Pro 7.00, winStr may be a subwindow path. The returned recreation macro is generated as if the 
subwindow were extracted from its host as a standalone window. See Subwindow Syntax on page III-92 
for details on forming the subwindow path.
The meaning of options depends on the type of window as described in the following sections.
Target Window Details
Target windows include graphs, tables, page layouts, panels, notebooks, and XOP target windows.
If options is 0, WinRecreation returns the window recreation macro.
If options is 1, WinRecreation returns the style macro or an empty string if the window does not support 
style macros.

2:

Graphs Details
If options is 2, WinRecreation returns a recreation macro in which all occurrences of wave names are 
replaced with an ID number having the form ##<number>## (for instance, ##25##). These ID numbers can 
be found easily using the strsearch function. This is intended for applications that need to alter the 
recreation macro by replacing wave names with something else, usually other wave names. The ID 
numbers are the same as those returned by the GetWindow operation with the wavelist keyword.
Graphs and Panels Details
If options is 4, WinRecreation returns the window recreation macro without the default behavior of causing 
the graph to revert to “normal” mode (as if the GraphNormal operation had been called). This allows the 
use of WinRecreation when a graph or panel is in drawing tools mode without exiting that mode. For 
windows other than graphs or panels, this is equivalent to an options value of 0.
Notebooks Details
If options is -1, WinRecreation returns the same text that the Generate Commands menu item would generate 
with the Selected paragraphs radio button selected and all the checkboxes selected (includes text commands).
If options is 0, WinRecreation returns the same text that the Generate Commands menu item would generate with 
the Entire document radio button selected and all the checkboxes except “Generate text commands” selected).
If options is 1, WinRecreation returns the same text that the Generate Commands menu item would generate 
with the Entire document radio button selected and all the checkboxes selected (includes text commands).
Regardless of the value of options the text returned by WinRecreation for notebook always ends with 5 lines 
of file-related information formatted as comments:
// File Name: MyNotebook.txt
// Path: "Macintosh HD:Desktop Folder:"
// Symbolic Path: home
// Selection Start: paragraph 100, position 31
// Selection End: paragraph 100, position 31
Help Windows Details
WinRecreation returns the same 5 lines of file-related information as described above for notebooks.
Set options to -3 to ensure that winStr is interpreted as a help window title (help windows have only titles, 
not window names).
Procedures Details
WinRecreation returns the same 5 lines of file-related information as described above for notebooks.
Set options to -2 to ensure that winStr is interpreted as a procedure window title (procedure windows have 
only titles, not window names).
If SetIgorOption IndependentModuleDev=1 is in effect, winStr can also be a procedure window title 
followed by a space and, in brackets, an independent module name. In such cases WinRecreation returns 
text from or information about the specified procedure file which is part of that independent module. (See 
Independent Modules on page IV-238 for independent module details.)
For example, in an experiment containing:
#pragma IndependentModule=myIM
#include <Axis Utilities>
code like this:
String text=WinRecreation("Axis Utilities.ipf [myIM]",-2)
will return the file-related information for the Axis Utilities.ipf procedure window, which is normally a 
hidden part of the myIM independent module.
To get the text content of a procedure window, use the ProcedureText function.
Examples
WinRecreation("Graph0",0)
// Returns recreation macro for Graph0.
WinRecreation("",1)
// Style macro for top window.
String win= WinName(0,16,1)
// top visible notebook
String str= WinRecreation(str,-1)
// Selected Text commands
Variable line= itemsInList(str,"\r")-5
// First file info line
Print StringFromList(line, str,"\r")
// Print File Name:
