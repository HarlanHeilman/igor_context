StatsKSTest 
StatsKSTest [flags] srcWave [, distWave]
The StatsKSTest operation performs the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit test for two continuous 
distributions. The first distribution is srcWave and the second distribution can be expressed either as the optional 
wave distWave or as a user function with /CDFF. Output is to the W_KSResults wave in the current data folder.

Details
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit test applies only to continuous distributions and cases 
where the compared distribution (expressed as a user function) is completely specified without estimating 
parameters from the data. It compares the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of two distributions and 
sets the test statistic D to the largest difference between the CDFs. Because CDFs are in the range [0,1], D is 
also bound by this range.
When specifying the distributions with two waves, StatsKSTest first sorts the data in the waves and then 
computes the CDFs and D. You can also specify one of the distributions with a user function. For example, 
the following function tests if the data in srcWave is normally distributed with zero mean and stdv=5:
Function GetUserCDF(inX) : CDFFunc
Variable inX
return StatsNormalCDF(inX,0,5)
End
The “: CDFFunc” designation, which requires Igor7 or later, tells Igor to make the function accessible from 
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test dialog.
Outputs are the number of elements, the KS statistic D, and the critical value. When both distributions are 
specified by waves, the number of elements is the weighted value (n1*n2)/(n1+n2).

StatsKSTest implements the original KS test. The difficulty in implementing the modified tests for all the 
cases defined by Stephens is in obtaining the critical values which have to be derived by time consuming 
Monte-Carlo simulations.
