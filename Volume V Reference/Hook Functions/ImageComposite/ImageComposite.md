# ImageComposite

ImageComposite
V-368
To generate an ROI masked filled with 1 in a region defined by a seed value and the boundary curves:
ImageBoundaryToMask 
ywave=yyy,xwave=xxx,width=100,height=200,scalingwave=src,seedx=550,seedy=700

The ImageAnalyzeParticles and ImageSeedFill operations. For another example see Converting 
Boundary to a Mask on page III-378.
ImageComposite
ImageComposite [/Z /FREE /DEST=destWave] srcImageA, srcImageB
The ImageComposite operation creates a new image by combining srcImageA and srcImageB subject to one 
of 12 Porter-Duff compositing modes.
The ImageComposite operation was added in Igor Pro 8.00.
Flags
Pre-multiplication
An RGB value can be raw or pre-multiplied. "Pre-multiplied" means that the red, green, and blue values 
have been multiplied by normalized alpha values in the range 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque). 
ImageComposite operation is faster when working with pre-multiplicated values. ImageComposite 
assumes that your RGB values are pre-multiplied unless you specify otherwise using /PMA=0 and /PMB=0.
Compositing Modes
Here are the 12 compositing modes supported by ImageComposite:
/AALP=aWave
Specifies a 2D single-precision wave as the alpha associated with srcImageA. Alpha 
values are in the range 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque).
/ACON=a1
Specifies a single alpha value for the whole srcImageA. a1 is in the range 0 
(transparent) to 1 (opaque).
/BALP=aWave
Specifies a 2D single-precision wave as the alpha associated with srcImageB. Alpha 
values are in the range 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque).
/BCON=a1
Specifies a single alpha value for the whole srcImageB. a1 is in the range 0 (transparent) 
to 1 (opaque).
/DEST=destWave
Specifies the wave to hold the composite image. If you omit /DEST the operation 
stores the image in the wave M_ImageComposite in the current data folder.
/FREE
Creates output wave as free waves.
/FREE is permitted in user-defined functions only, not from the command line or in 
macros.
If you use /FREE then destWave must be simple name, not a path.
/NMOD=mode
Selects one of the 12 Porter-Duff compositing modes. mode is a value from 1 to 12. The 
default is mode=4 corresponding to "A over B". See Compositing Modes on page 
V-368.
/OUT=layers
Specifies the number of layers of the output image. Valid values are 3 (RGB) or 4 
(RGBA). By default the operation creates an RGB image.
/PMA=pmState
Set pmState to 1 if the RGB components in srcImageA are pre-multiplied. Use pmState=0 
otherwise. By default srcImageA is assumed to be pre-multiplied. See Pre-
multiplication on page V-368.
/PMB=pmState
Set pmState to 1 if the RGB components in srcImageB are pre-multiplied. Use 
pmStates=0 otherwise. By default srcImageB is assumed to be pre-multiplied. See Pre-
multiplication on page V-368.
/Z
No error reporting. The operation sets V_Flag to 0 if it succeeds or to an error code 
otherwise. You can use GetErrMessage to obtain a description of the error.

Details
ImageComposite computes an output RGB or RGBA image that result from compositing srcImageA and 
srcImageB using one of the Porter-Duff compositing modes shown in the table above. The waves srcImageA 
and srcImageB must have the same number of pixels and the same number type.
Supported number types are: unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, single precision floating point 
and double precision floating point. When using integer waves expected alpha values are in the range 
[0,2^N-1] where N is the number of bits of the number type. Floating point waves should include alpha in 
the range [0,1]. 
There are three options to specify the alpha associated with each image: 
1. The alpha can be expressed as the 4th layer in the wave.
2. The alpha can be specified by a single-precision wave that has the same number of pixels as the image 
using the /AALP and /BALP flags.
3. The alpha can be specified by a single number in the range [0,1] using the /ACON and /BCON flags.
Options 2 and 3 cannot override an alpha channel that is present in a source wave. To use these options you 
must delete the alpha channel in the source wave, if any.
