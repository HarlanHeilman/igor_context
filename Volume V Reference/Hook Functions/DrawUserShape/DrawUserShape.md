# DrawUserShape

DrawUserShape
V-179
Flags
Details
The coordinate system as well as the text’s font, size, style and other properties are determined by the 
current drawing environment. The text is drawn in the current draw layer for the window, as determined 
by SetDrawLayer.

DrawUserShape
DrawUserShape [/W=winName /MO=options] x0, y0, x1, y1, userFuncName, textString, 
privateString
The DrawUserShape operation is similar to built-in drawing operations except the shape is defined by a 
user-defined function which is executed when the shape is drawn.
DrawUserShape was added in Igor Pro 7.00.
Parameters
For rectangular shapes (x0,y0) defines the top left corner while (x1,y1) defines the lower right corner in the 
currently active coordinate system. For line-like shapes, (x0,y0) specifies the start of the line while(x1,y1) 
specifies the end.
userFuncName specifies your user-defined function that uses built-in drawing operations to define the 
shape and provides information about it to Igor. 
textString specifies text to be drawn over the shape by Igor. Pass "" if you do not need text. Using escape 
codes you can change the font, size, style, and color of the text. See Annotation Escape Codes on page III-53 
or details.
privateString is text or binary data used by the user-defined function for any purpose. It is typically used to 
maintain state information and is saved in recreation macros using a method that supports binary. Pass "" 
if you do not need this.
To support modifying an existing shape, each of the last three parameters above can be _NoChange_. The 
x0, y0, x1, y1 parameters can be all zero for no change. Using _NoChange_ when there is no existing shape 
is an error. To target an existing shape, it must be selected by the drawing tools.

Details
The user-defined function must have the following form and structure parameter.
Function MyUserShape(s) : DrawUserShape // Optional ": DrawUserShape" indicates
// that this function should be added
STRUCT WMDrawUserShapeStruct &s
// to the menu of shapes in the drawing palette
Variable returnValue= 1
/W=winName
Draws to the named window or subwindow. When omitted, action will affect the 
active window or subwindow. This must be the first flag specified when used in a 
Proc or Macro or on the command line.
When identifying a subwindow with winName, see Subwindow Syntax on page III-92 
for details on forming the window hierarchy.
/W=winName
Draws to the named window or subwindow. When omitted, action will affect the 
active window or subwindow. This must be the first flag specified when used in a 
Proc or Macro or on the command line.
When identifying a subwindow with winName, see Subwindow Syntax on page III-92 
for details on forming the window hierarchy.
/M=options
An integer that Igor passes to your user-defined drawing function for use for any 
purpose.

WMDrawUserShapeStruct is a built-in structure with the following members:
WMDrawUserShapeStruct Structure Members
Member
Description
char action[32]
Input: Specifies what action is requested.
Int32 options
Input: Value from /MO flag.
Output: When action is getInfo, set bits as follows:
Set bit 0 if the shape should behave like a simple line. When 
resizing end-points, you will get live updates.
Set bit 1 if the shape is to act like a button; you will get mouse 
down in normal operate mode.
Set bit 2 to get roll-over action. You will get hitTest action 
and if 1 is returned, the mouse will be captured.
Int32 operateMode
Input: If 0, the shape is being edited; if 1, normal operate mode 
(only if options bit 1 or 2 was set during getInfo).
PointF mouseLoc
Input: The location of the mouse in normalized coordinates.

DrawUserShape
V-181
The constants used to size the char arrays, MAX_HostChildSpec and MAX_OBJ_NAME, are defined 
internally in Igor and are subject to change in future versions.
The drawing commands you provide for the draw and drawSelected actions must use normalized 
coordinates ranging from (0,0) to (1,1). For example, to draw a rectangle you would use
DrawRect 0,0,1,1
Generally, you will not set drawing environment parameters such as color or fill mode but will leave that 
to the user of your shape just as they would for built-in shapes such as a Rectangle.
Drawing commands such as SetDrawEnv, DrawRect, etc., include a /W flag that directs their action to a 
particular window or subwindow. However, when called from a DrawUserShape function, the /W flag is 
ignored and all drawing commands are directed to the window or subwindow containing the shape.
You will get the drawSelected action when the user has selected your shape with the arrow draw tool. 
For simple shapes, this can use the same code as the draw action but if you want the shape to be editable, 
you can draw control points such as a yellow dot. You would then provide code in the hitTest and 
mouseDown actions that determines if the user has moved over or clicked on a control point. For an example 
of this, see the FatArrows procedure file in the User Draw Shapes demo experiment.
Your function should respond to the getInfo action by setting the textString field to a category name and 
the privateString field to a shape name. A category name might be "Arrows" and a shape name might be 
"Right Arrow". These names are used to populate the menus you get when right-clicking the user shapes 
icon in the drawing tools palette. You can also set bits in the options field to enable certain special actions. 
For examples of these, see the LineCallout and button procedure windows in the User Draw Shapes demo 
experiment.
Because the user-defined function runs during a drawing operation that cannot be interrupted without 
crashing Igor, the debugger cannot be invoked while it is running. Consequently breakpoints set in the 
function are ignored. Use Debugging With Print Statements on page IV-212 instead.
To support button-like shapes in graphs and layouts, an additional drawing layer named Overlay was 
added in Igor Pro 7.00. This layer is drawn over the top of everything else and is not printed or exported. 
Objects in the Overlay draw layer can update without the need to redraw the entire window as would be 
Int32 doSetCursor
Output: If action is hitTest, set true to use the following 
cursor number. Also used for mouseMoved in rollover mode.
Int32 cursorCode
Output: If action is hitTest and doSetCursor is set, then set 
this to the desired Igor cursor number.
double x0,y0,x1,y1
Input: Coordinates of the enclosing rectangle of the shape.
RectF objectR
Input: Coordinates of the enclosing rectangle of the shape in 
device units.
char winName[MAX_HostChildSpec+1]
Full path to host subwindow
// Information about the coordinate system
Rect drawRect
Draw rect in device coordinates
Rect plotRect
In a graph, this is the plot area
Rect axisRect
In a graph, this is the plot area including axis standoff
char xcName[MAX_OBJ_NAME+1]
Name of X coordinate system, may be axis name
char ycName[MAX_OBJ_NAME+1]
Name of Y coordinate system, may be axis name
double angle
Input: Rotation angle, use when displaying text
String textString
Input: Use or ignore; special output for getInfo
String privateString
Input and output: Maintained by Igor but defined by user 
function; may be binary; special output for getInfo
