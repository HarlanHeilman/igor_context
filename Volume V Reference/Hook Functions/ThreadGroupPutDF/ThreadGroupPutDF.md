ThreadGroupCreate 
ThreadGroupCreate(nt)
The ThreadGroupCreate function creates a thread group containing nt threads and returns a thread ID 
number. Use the number of computer processors for nt when trying to improve computation speed using 
parallel threads. A background worker might use just one thread regardless of the number of processors.

ThreadGroupGetDF 
ThreadGroupGetDF(tgID, waitms)
ThreadGroupGetDFR should be used instead of ThreadGroupGetDF which causes memory leaks.
The ThreadGroupGetDF function retrieves a data folder path string from a thread group queue and 
removes the data folder from the queue.
When called from a preemptive thread it returns a data folder from the thread group's input queue. When 
called from the main thread it returns a data folder from the thread group's output queue.
tgID is a thread group ID returned by ThreadGroupCreate. You can pass 0 for tgID when calling 
ThreadGroupGetDF from a preemptive thread. You must pass a valid thread group ID when calling 
ThreadGroupGetDF from the main thread.
waitms is the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for a data folder to become available in the queue. 
Pass 0 to test if a data folder is available immediately. Pass INF to wait indefinitely or until a user abort.
ThreadGroupGetDF returns "" if the timeout period specified by waitms expires and no data folder is 
available in the queue.

The ThreadGroupGetDFR function.
ThreadGroupGetDFR 
ThreadGroupGetDFR(tgID, waitms)
The ThreadGroupGetDF function retrieves a data folder reference from a thread group queue and removes 
the data folder from the queue. The data folder becomes a free data folder.
When called from a preemptive thread it returns a data folder from the thread group's input queue. When 
called from the main thread it returns a data folder from the thread group's output queue.
tgID is a thread group ID returned by ThreadGroupCreate. You can pass 0 for tgID when calling 
ThreadGroupGetDFR from a preemptive thread. You must pass a valid thread group ID when calling 
ThreadGroupGetDFR from the main thread.
waitms is the maximum number of milliseconds to wait for a data folder to become available in the queue. 
Pass 0 to test if a data folder is available immediately. Pass INF to wait indefinitely or until a user abort.
ThreadGroupGetDFR returns a NULL data folder reference if the timeout period specified by waitms 
expires and no data folder is available in the queue. You can test for NULL using DataFolderRefStatus.
