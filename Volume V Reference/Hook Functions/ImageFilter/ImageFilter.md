ImageFileInfo is no longer supported and always returns an error.
It is obsolete because it used QuickTime to obtain graphics file information and Apple is phasing out 
QuickTime.
ImageFilter 
ImageFilter [flags] Method dataMatrix
The ImageFilter operation is identical to MatrixFilter, accepting the same parameters and flags, with the 
exception of the additional features described below.
Parameters
Method selects the filter type. Method is one of the following names:
Flags
Details
You can operate on 3D waves using the 3D filters listed above. These filters are extensions of the 2D filters 
available under MatrixFilter. The avg3d, gauss3d, and point3d filters are implemented by a 3D convolution 
that uses an averaging compensation at the edges.
This operation does not support complex waves.

avg3d
nxnxn average filter for 3D waves.
gauss3d
nxnxn gaussian filter for 3D waves.
hybridmedian
Implements ranking pixel values between two groups of pixels in a 5x5 
neighborhood. The first group includes horizontal and vertical lines through the 
center, the second group includes diagonal lines through the center, and both groups 
include the center pixel itself. The resulting median value is the ranked median of 
both groups and the center pixel.
max3d
nxnxn maximum rank filter for 3D waves.
median3d
nxnxn median filter for 3D waves where n must be of the form 3r (integer r), e.g., 
3x3x3, 9x9x9 etc. The filter does not change the value of the voxel it is centered on if 
any of the filter voxels lies outside the domain of the data.
min3d
nxnxn minimum rank filter for 3D waves.
point3d
nxnxn point finding filter using normalized (n3-1)*center-outer for 3D waves.
/N=n
Specifies the filter size. By default n =3. In most situations it will be useful to set n to 
an odd number in order to preserve the symmetry in the filters.
/O
Overwrites the source image with the output image. Used only with the 
hybridmedian filter, which does not automatically overwrite the source wave.
