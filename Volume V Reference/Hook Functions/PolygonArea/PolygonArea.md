# PolygonArea

PolygonArea
V-750
coefsWaveName is a wave that contains the polynomial coefficients. The number of points in the wave 
determines the number of terms in the polynomial and therefore the polynomial degree.
In a complex expression, poly2D requires x1 and y1 to be complex numbers, and returns a complex value. 
The wave containing the coefficients may be real or complex. Real coefficients are interpreted as cmplx(coef, 
0). Passing complex coefficients in a real expression will use only the real part of the coefficients.
Details
The coefficients wave contains polynomial coefficients for low degree terms first. All coefficients for terms 
of a given degree must be present, even if they are zero. Among coefficients for a given degree, those for 
terms having higher powers of X are first. Thus, poly2D returns, for a coefficient wave cw:
f(x,y) = cw[0] + cw[1]*x + cw[2]*y + cw[3]*x^2 + cw[4]*x*y + cw[5]*y^2 + …
A 2D polynomial of degree N has (N+1)(N+2)/2 terms.
Poly2D Example 1
Fill mat1 with the polynomial 1 + 2*x + 2.5*y + 3*x2 + 3.5*xy + 4*y2 evaluated over the range x = (-1, 1) and y 
= (-1, 1):
Function Poly2DExample1()
Make/O coefs1 = {1, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4}
Make/N=(20,20)/O mat1
SetScale/I x, -1, 1, mat1
SetScale/I y, -1, 1, mat1
mat1 = poly2D(coefs1, x, y)
Display; AppendMatrixContour mat1
End
The polynomial is second degree, so the first command above made the wave coefs with six elements 
because (2+1)(2+2)/2 = 6.
Poly2D Example 2
Fill mat2 with the polynomial 1 + 2*x + 3*y+ 4*x2 + 4*y2 + 5*x3 + 6*y3 evaluated over the range x = (-1, 1) and 
y = (-1, 1). The first zero eliminates the second-order cross term x*y and the second and third zeros eliminate 
the third-order cross terms x2*y and x*y2:
Function Poly2DExample2()
Make/O coefs2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0, 6}
Make/N=(20,20)/O mat2
SetScale/I x, -1, 1, mat2
SetScale/I y, -1, 1, mat2
mat2 = poly2D(coefs2, x, y)
Display; AppendMatrixContour mat2
End
Poly2D Example 3
This example illustrates using poly2D in a complex expression:
Function Poly2DExample3()
Make/N=(200,200)/C/O cMat3
// Complex-valued matrix
SetScale/I x -pi,pi,cMat3
SetScale/I y -pi,pi,cMat3
Make/D/O coefs3={1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5}
cMat3 = poly2d(coefs3, cmplx(sin(x),cos(y)), cmplx(cos(x),sin(y)))
Display; Appendimage cMat3
ModifyImage cMat3 ctab= {*,*,Rainbow256,0}
ModifyImage cMat3 imCmplxMode=3
// Display the complex phase
End
PolygonArea 
PolygonArea(xWave, yWave)
The PolygonArea function returns the area of a simple, closed, convex or nonconvex planar polygon 
described by consecutive vertices in xWave and yWave.
A simple polygon has no internal “holes” and its boundary curve does not intersect itself. Both xWave and 
yWave must be 1D, real, numerical waves of the same dimensions. The minimum number of vertices is 3. 
The function uses the shoelace algorithm to compute the area (see theorem 1.3.3 in the reference below). If 
there is any error in the input, the function returns NaN.
