12.
Drag the tag up and to the right about 1 cm.
You can now see the arrow.
13.
With the cursor over the text of the tag, press Option (Macintosh) or Alt (Windows).
The cursor changes to this shape: 
. (You may need to nudge the cursor slightly to make it change.)
14.
While pressing Option (Macintosh) or Alt (Windows), drag the box cursor to a different data point.
The tag jumps to the new data point and the text is updated to show the new X and Y values. Option-drag 
(Macintosh) or Alt-drag (Windows) the tag to different data points to see their X and Y values.
Notice that the tip of the arrow touches the marker. This doesn’t look good, so let’s change it.
15.
Double-click the text part of the tag.
The Modify Annotation dialog appears.
16.
Click the Tag Arrow tab and change the Line/Arrow Standoff from “Auto” to “10”.
17.
Click the Change button.
The tip of the arrow now stops 10 points from the marker.
Using Preferences
If you have already set preferences to your liking and do not want to disturb them, you can skip this section.
1.
Choose MiscPreferences On.
2.
Click the graph window if it is not already active.
3.
Choose the GraphCapture Graph Prefs menu item.
The Capture Graph Preferences dialog appears.
4.
Click the checkboxes for XY plot axes and for XY plot wave styles.
5.
Click Capture Preferences.
6.
Choose WindowsNew Graph.
7.
Choose “yval” as the Y wave and “timeval” as the X wave.
8.
Click Do It.
The new graph is created with a style similar to the model graph.
9.
Press Option (Macintosh) or Alt (Windows) while clicking the close button of the new graph.
The new graph is killed without presenting a dialog.
10.
Choose GraphCapture Graph Prefs.
11.
Click the checkboxes for XY plot axes and for XY plot wave styles.
12.
Click Revert to Defaults.
13.

We turn preferences off during the guided tour to ensures that the tour works the same for everyone. 
This is not something you would do during normal work.
Making a Page Layout

4.
Click Do It.
A page layout window appears with a Table0 object on top of a Graph0 object.
The layout initially shows the page at 50% magnification but you may prefer to work at 100%. You can 
use the pop-up menu in the lower left corner of the window to change magnification.
5.
Click the Table0 object in the layout window.
The table object becomes selected, resize handles are drawn around the edges, and the cursor changes 
to a hand when over the table.
6.
Click in the middle of the table and drag it so you can see the right edge of the table.
7.
Position the cursor over the handle (small black square) in the middle of the right edge of the table.
The cursor changes to a two headed arrow indicating you can drag in the direction of the arrows.
8.
Drag the edge of the table to the left until it is close to the edge of the third column of numbers.
You need only get close — Igor snaps to the nearest grid line.
9.
In a similar fashion, adjust the bottom of the table to show all the data but without any blank rows.
10.
Arrange the table and graph objects in the layout to approximately match this picture:
11.
Click this icon in the tool palette: 
.
This activates the drawing tools.
12.
Click this icon in the drawing tool palette: 
.
This is the polygon tool.
