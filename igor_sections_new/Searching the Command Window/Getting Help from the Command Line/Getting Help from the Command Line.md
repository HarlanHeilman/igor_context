# Getting Help from the Command Line

Chapter II-2 — The Command Window
II-12
If the history area has keyboard focus, usually indicated by an active selection in the history, the find bar 
searches the history area. If the command window has keyboard focus, the find bar searches the command 
line. To be sure that Find will search the area that you want, you can click in that area before starting the 
search.
Command Window Magnification
You can magnify the size of text in the command line and history area.
To magnify the command line text, right-click in the command line and select an item from the Magnification 
submenu. To make the new magnification your default magnification for new experiments, right-click again 
and choose Set as Default for Command Line from the same submenu.
To magnify the history area text, right-click in the history area and select an item from the Magnification sub-
menu. To make the new magnification your default magnification for new experiments, right-click again and 
choose Set as Default for History Area from the same submenu.
Command Window Formats
You can change the text format used for the command line. For example, you might prefer a different color. 
To do this, click in the command line and then choose Set Text Format from the Command Buffer submenu 
of the Misc menu. To set the text format for the history area, click in the history area and then choose Set Text 
Format from the History Area submenu of the Misc menu. To do this, the history area must have some text in 
it.
You can set other properties, such as background color, by choosing Document Settings from the Command 
Buffer or History Area submenus. The Document Settings dialog also sets the header and footer used when 
printing the history.
When you change the text format or document settings, you are changing the current experiment only. You 
may want to capture the new format and settings as a preference for new experiments. To do this, choose 
Capture Prefs from the Command Buffer and History Area submenus.
Getting Help from the Command Line
When working with the command line, you might need help in formulating a command. There are short-
cuts that allow you to insert a template, view help, or find the definition of a user function. The command 
line also supports Command Completion.
To insert a template, type the name of the operation or function, Control-click (Macintosh) or right-click 
(Windows), and choose Insert Template.
To view help or to view the definition of a user function, type the name of the operation or function, 
Control-click (Macintosh) or right-click (Windows), and choose Help for <name>.
