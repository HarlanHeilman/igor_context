Graph, Table, String, and Expressions Inspectors
One of the Wave, String, or Expressions Inspectors is visible to right side of the variables list. This pane is 
hidden when the divider between the pane and the variables list is dragged all the way to the right. Drag 
the divider to the left to show the pane. You may need to widen the window to make room.
Use the popup to select the Inspector you want.
The pop-up menu controls what is shown in the pane:
