tural keywords. Matching keywords are at the same level of indentation and all lines within those 
keywords are indented by one tab.
The Edit menu contains aids for maintaining or adjusting indentation. You can select multiple lines and 
choose Indent Left or Indent Right. You can have Igor automatically adjust the indentation of a procedure 
by selecting the whole procedure or a subset and then choosing Adjust Indentation.
Igor does not require that you use indentation but we recommend it for readability.
What’s Next
The next chapter covers the core of Igor programming — writing user-defined functions.
Chapter IV-4, Macros, explains macros. Because new programming does not use macros, that chapter is 
mostly of use for understanding old Igor code.
Chapter IV-5, User-Defined Menus, explains user-defined menus. It explains how you can add menu items 
to existing Igor menus and create entire new menus of your own.
Chapter IV-6, Interacting with the User, explains other methods of interacting with the user, including the 
use of dialogs, control panels, and cursors.
Chapter IV-7, Programming Techniques, covers an assortment of programming topics. An especially 
important one is the use of the include statement, which you use to build procedures on top of existing pro-
cedures.
Chapter IV-8, Debugging, covers debugging using Igor’s symbolic debugger.
Chapter IV-9, Dependencies, covers dependencies — a way to tie a variable or wave to a formula.
Chapter IV-10, Advanced Topics, covers advanced topics, such as communicating with other programs, 
doing FTP transfers, doing data acquisition, and creating a background task.
