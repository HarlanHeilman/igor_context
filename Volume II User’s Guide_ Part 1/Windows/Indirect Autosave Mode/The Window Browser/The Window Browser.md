change the appearance of the window. For example, a graph style macro may change the color of graph 
traces or the axis tick marks.
Style macros are used most effectively with graph windows. For more information, see Saving and Recre-
ating Graphs on page II-350 and Graph Style Macros on page II-350.
The Window Control Dialog
Choosing ControlWindow Control displays the Window Control dialog which you can use to change the 
top window’s title and name, and create or update its recreation and style macros. You can access this dialog 
quickly by pressing Command-Y (Macintosh) or Ctrl+Y (Windows).
You can also change the window’s name. The window name is used to address the window from command 
line operations such as MoveWindow and also appears in the macro submenus of the Windows menu.
For more about names and titles, see Window Names and Titles on page II-45. Also see Saving a Window 
as a Recreation Macro on page II-47 for a discussion of window recreation macros, and see Graph Style 
Macros on page II-350 for details on style macros.
The Window Browser
The Window Browser allows you to find and manage windows of interest. Choose WindowsWindow 
Browser to activate it.
The window list on the right side lists windows that meet the current filtering criteria. You can filter 
windows by name, by type, by visibility (visible or hidden), and based on whether they display a specific 
wave. Clicking the funnel icon at the bottom of the list toggles the display of advanced filtering controls. 
Clicking the gear icon displays the options menu in which you can set sorting and display options.
If a single window is selected in the window list, the controls on the left display information about the 
window. The buttons at the top of the Selection area control the types of information that are displayed. 
You can choose to display the following types of information:
•
Window Information
Includes the window name, window title, and window note. See Window Names and Titles on 
page II-45 for a discussion of the distinction between names and titles.
•
Waves in Window
Displays a list of waves used by the window. Right-click a wave icon to edit the wave in a table, view 
it in the Data Browser, or set the current data folder to the wave's data folder. You can also toggle 
display of full paths by right clicking anywhere in the list.
You can select one or more waves in the list and drag them into an existing graph or table window 
to append them to the target window. See Appending Traces by Drag and Drop on page II-280 for 
details.
•
Layout Objects
Displays information about the pages in the selected page layout window and the objects on each 
page.
If multiple windows are selected, the Window Information control displays a list of window names.
The buttons above the window list allow you to show, hide, close the selected windows and to bring them 
to the front or send them to the back.
You can append selected graph, table, and Gizmo windows to a page layout by dragging them from the 
window list into a layout or by right clicking in the window list and choosing the appropriate item.
You can add menu items to the contextual menu in the window list. See WindowBrowserWindowsPopup 
Menu on page IV-140 for details.
