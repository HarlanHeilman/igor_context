Arranging Windows
You can tile or stack windows by choosing the appropriate items from the Control submenu in the 
Windows menu.
You can customize the behavior of the Tile and Stack items using the Tile or Stack Windows dialog.
You can also move windows around using the MoveWindow, StackWindows, and TileWindows commands.
The Tile or Stack Windows Dialog
The Tile or Stack Windows dialog is useful for tiling a few windows or even for setting the size and position 
of a single window.
Select individual windows from the Windows to Arrange list, and entire classes of windows with the checkboxes.
If you want subsequent selections of the Tile (or Stack) menu item to stack the same types of windows with 
the same rows, columns, grout, tiling area, etc., check the “Capture as pref” checkbox. Windows selected in 
the Windows to Arrange menu aren’t remembered by the preferences; only the window type checkboxes 
are remembered. There are separate settings and preferences for Stack and for Tile.
Although the TileWindows and StackWindows operations can tile and stack panels, panels don’t show up 
here because they don’t resize very well.
The Window Tiling Area subdialog specifies the area where tiling and stacking take place.
You can specify the tiling area in one of four ways:
•
By entering screen positions in units of points
•
By dragging the pictorial representation of the tiling area
•
By clicking the “Use default area” button to use the default tiling area
•
By positioning any non-dialog window before you enter the dialog, and clicking the “Use top win-
dow” button
Window Position and Size Management
There are four items in the Control submenu of the Windows menu that help you manage the position and 
size of windows.
Move to Preferred Position
Moves the active window to the position and size determined by preferences. For each type of window, you 
can set the preferred position and size using the Capture Prefs dialog (e.g., Capture Graph Prefs for graphs).
Move to Full Size Position
Moves and sizes the active window to display as much of the content as practical. On Macintosh, this is the 
same as clicking the zoom button. On Windows, the size is limited to the size of the frame window.
Retrieve Window
Moves the active window and sizes it if necessary so that all of the window is visible.
Retrieve All Windows
Moves all windows and sizes them if necessary so that all of each window is within the screen on Macintosh 
or within the frame on Windows. This is often useful when you open an experiment that was created on a 
system with a larger screen or Windows frame than yours.
Send to Back — Bring to Front
The Send to Back item in the Windows menu sends the top window to the bottom of the desktop, behind 
all other windows. This function can also be accessed by pressing Command-’ (Macintosh) or Ctrl+E (Win-
dows). After sending a window behind, you can bring it to the front by choosing Bring to Front or by press-
