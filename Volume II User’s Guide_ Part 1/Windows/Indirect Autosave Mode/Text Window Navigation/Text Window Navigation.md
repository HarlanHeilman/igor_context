or Control-Return. You can also execute selected commands by Control-clicking (Macintosh) or right-click-

Text Window Navigation
The term “keyboard navigation” refers to selection and scrolling actions that Igor performs in response to 
the arrow keys and to the Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys. Macintosh and Windows have dif-
ferent conventions for these actions in windows containing text. You can use either Macintosh or Windows 
conventions on either platform.
By default, Igor uses Macintosh conventions on Macintosh and Windows conventions on Windows. You 
can change this using the Keyboard Navigation menu in the Misc Settings section of the Miscellaneous Set-
tings dialog. If you use Macintosh conventions on Windows, use Ctrl in place of the Macintosh Command 
key. If you use Windows conventions on Macintosh, use Command in place of the Windows Ctrl key.

ported. Alt-Left-Arrow is the keyboard shortcut for EditGo Back and Alt-Right-Arrow is the keyboard
