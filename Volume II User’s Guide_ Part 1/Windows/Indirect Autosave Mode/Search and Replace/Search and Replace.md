The Find Bar
The find bar is available in help, procedure and notebook windows, and other places where you might need 
to search for text. To display it, choose EditFind or press Command-F (Macintosh) or Ctrl+F (Windows). 
The Find Bar appears at the top of the host window:
Enter text in the Find edit box and press the right arrow icon to find the next occurrence of the text. Press 
the left arrow icon to find the preceding occurrence.
You can also find the next occurrence by pressing Command-G (Macintosh) or Ctrl+G (Windows). You can 
also find the preceding occurrence by pressing Command-Shift-G (Macintosh) or Ctrl+Shift+G (Windows). 
You can set the text to be found by selecting it in the active window and pressing Command-E (Macintosh) 
or Ctrl+H (Windows).
By default, when you use these keyboard equivalents, if the find bar is not showing, Igor displays it. If you 
prefer that Igor not display the find bar when you use these equivalents, click the gear icon and check the 
Show Find Bar on EditFind Only checkbox.
You can set the size of the find bar using the gear icon.
To hide the find bar, click the Done button or press the Esc key.

If the window you are working on contains editable text, you can choose EditReplace or press Command-
R (Macintosh) or Ctrl+R (Windows) to display the replace text portion of the find bar:
While replacing text is undoable, the potential for unintended and wide-ranging consequences is such that 
we recommend saving the file before doing a mass replace using Replace All so you can revert-to-saved if 
necessary.
