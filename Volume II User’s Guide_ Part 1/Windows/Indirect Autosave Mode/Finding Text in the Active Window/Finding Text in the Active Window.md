Text Window Go Back and Go Forward
Certain actions add entries to a go-back stack that Igor maintains in memory. These actions include opening 
a text window, doing a find, clicking a help link, right-clicking and choosing the Help For and Go To menu 
items, and using the navigation bar.
You can return to locations in text windows that you recently visited using the Go Back and Go Forward 
buttons. These appear in the navigation bar of procedure and help windows and in the status area of note-
book windows. The Go Back button looks like a "less-than" symbol and the Go Forward button looks like a 
"greater-than" symbol. You can also use the Edit menu Go Back and Go Forward items or their keyboard 
equivalents:
If your mouse has Go Back and Go Forward buttons, you can use them also.
Between the Go Back and Go Forward buttons is a button which when clicked displays the Go Back pop-
up menu. You can return to a specific recently-visited location by choosing an item from a submenu in the 
Go Back pop-up menu.
Igor can keep the go back locations for all text windows in one stack or it can keep separate stacks for pro-
cedure windows, notebook windows and help windows. You control this using the "Separate stacks for 
procedure, notebook, help windows" menu item in the Go Back pop-up menu. When that item is checked, 
Igor maintains separate stacks. When it is unchecked, Igor maintains one stack for all three types of win-
dows. Which you choose is a matter of taste. The advantage of keeping multiple stacks is that it most of the 
time you are interested in windows of the same type. The advantage of keeping just one stack is that it 
allows you to go back to a procedure file after right-clicking for help for an Igor operation or function.
Igor keeps a maximum of 25 locations in each stack and discards older locations when necessary.
