# Table Keyboard Navigation

Chapter II-12 — Tables
II-237
For waves displayed in multiple columns (complex waves and multidimensional waves), if you change the 
display format of any data column from the wave, Igor changes the format for all data columns from that wave.
One of the items in the pop-up menu is Delay Update. Normally, when you change the value of a cell in the 
table, Igor immediately updates any other tables or graphs to reflect the new value. Enabling Delay Update 
forces this updating of other tables and graphs to be postponed until you click in another window or disable 
Delay Update. When Delay Update has been enabled, there is a checkmark next to the menu item. You can 
do this if you have a list of values to enter into a table and you don’t want other tables or graphs to be 
updated until you are finished.
Delay Update does not delay updates when you remove or add cells to a wave. It only delays updates when 
you change the value of a cell.
Showing and Hiding Parts of a Table
The Table menu has a Show submenu that shows or hides various parts of a table. This is of use only in 
specialized situations such as when you are using a table subwindow in a control panel to display data but 
don’t want the user to enter data. For normal use you should leave all of the items in the Show submenu 
checked so that all parts of the table will be visible.
When the entry line is hidden, the user can not change values in the table.
Arrow Keys in Tables
By default, if you are in the process of entering data, the arrow keys accept the entry as if you pressed Enter 
and then move the selected cell.
Some users prefer to use the arrow keys to move the selection in the entry line when an entry is in progress. You 
can specify your preference via the Table Settings category in the Miscellaneous Settings dialog (Misc menu).
Table Keyboard Navigation
The term “keyboard navigation” refers to selection and scrolling actions in response to the arrow keys and to the 
Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys. Macintosh and Windows have different conventions for these 
actions in windows containing text. You can use either Macintosh or Windows conventions on either platform.
By default, Macintosh conventions apply on Macintosh and Windows conventions apply on Windows. You 
can change this using the Keyboard Navigation menu in the Misc Settings section of the Miscellaneous Set-
tings Dialog. If you use Macintosh conventions on Windows, use Ctrl in place of Command. If you use 
Windows conventions on Macintosh, use Command in place of Ctrl.
