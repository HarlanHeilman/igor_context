Decimal Symbol and Thousands Separator in Tables
By default, the decimal symbol for entering a number in a table is period. You can change this to comma or 
Per System Setting using the TableTable Misc Settings menu. The selected decimal symbol is used for 
entering, copying, and pasting data in tables.
The Decimal Symbol setting controls the character that is produced when you press the decimal key on the 
numeric keypad while entering a value in the entry area of a table.
If comma is selected as the decimal symbol then it is not supported as a column separator when creating 
new waves by pasting text into a table.
When you choose Per System Setting, the decimal symbol is determined by your system settings as of when 
Igor was launched. Only period and comma are supported as the decimal symbol. If you choose any 
decimal symbol other than comma, period will be used as the decimal symbol for tables.
