Chapter II-13 — Graphs
II-310
The grid line thickness is specified as a fraction of the axis line thickness. Since the axis line thickness is 
usually one point, and computer monitors usually have a resolution of about a point, it generally is not pos-
sible to see the differences in thickness on your screen. You can see the difference in exported and printed 
graphs.
The examples here show graphs with thicker than normal axis lines and the thickest grid lines:
Using the settings "Draw from" and "to" you can restrict the length of the grid lines. This is useful if you 
have used the similar settings on the Axis tab to shorten one of your axes, and you want grid lines to match.
Zero Line
You can control the zero line for the selected axis using the Zero Line checkbox.
The zero line is a line perpendicular to the axis extending across the graph at the point where the value of 
the axis is zero. The Zero Line checkbox is not available for log axes.
If you turn the zero line on then you will be able to choose the line style from the Style pop-up menu. The 
thickness of the line can be set in fractional points from 0 to 5. The zero line has the same color as the axis.
Tick Options Tab
The Tick Options tab provides fine control over tick marks and tick mark labels.
