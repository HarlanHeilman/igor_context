# Making Boxes and Violins Look Different

If your X axis is a numeric axis, you don't need the last step of setting the Grouping mode. The two violin 
plot traces draw the plots at the numeric value set by the X wave, or at 0, 1, 2, and so on, if you chose Cal-
culated.
Finally, you may decide that the plot looks better with a line enclosing the entire color-filled area. On the 
General tab of the Modify Violin Plot dialog, turn on the Close Outline checkbox:

Making Boxes and Violins Look Different
At times you may want one of the boxes or violins in a trace to have a different appearance to distinguish 
the corresponding dataset from others in the trace. The Modify Box Plot and Modify Violin Plot dialogs 
support this by allowing you to select a single dataset from a trace.
This graphic shows the Modify Box Plot dialog with a box plot trace made with a list of three waves. The 
first wave in the list was wave0, so the name of the trace is "wave0". Clicking the triangle icon for the wave0 
trace discloses a list of the three datasets, one for each wave.
If the top wave0 item were selected, changes made in the dialog would apply to all datasets in the trace. 
Here we have selected the second dataset corresponding to wave1 so changes made in the dialog apply only 
to the dataset and consequently to the second box in the box plot.
These graphs show before and after setting the box fill color for the wave1 dataset only to light blue:
