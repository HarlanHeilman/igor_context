# Setting the Range of an Axis

Chapter II-13 — Graphs
II-286
The Shrink operation scales all axes so that the waves in the graph appear smaller (zoom out). The factor 
by which the waves shrink is equal to the ratio of the size of the marquee to the size of the entire graph. For 
example, if the marquee is one half the size of the graph then the waves shrink to one half their former size. 
The point at the center of the marquee becomes the new center of the graph. The shrink operation sets the 
scaling mode for all axes to manual.
The Horiz Shrink operation is like the shrink operation but affects the horizontal axes only. It sets the 
scaling mode for the horizontal axes to manual.
The Vert Shrink operation is like the shrink operation but affects the vertical axes only. It sets the scaling 
mode for the vertical axes to manual.
Another way to manually scale axes is to use the Axis Range tab of the Modify Axis dialog (see Manual 
Axis Ranges on page II-287), or the SetAxis operation (page V-835).
Scaling Using the Mouse Wheel
You can manually scale a graph axis using the mouse wheel. The scaling performed is determined by where 
along the axis you position the mouse. Start by positioning the mouse over the axis until the cursor changes 
to a double-ended arrow.
If you position the mouse over the middle of the axis and rotate the wheel, both ends of the axis are scaled 
equally.
If you position the mouse over one end of the axis and rotate the wheel, that end remains fixed and the other 
end of the axis is scaled.
If you position the mouse between the middle and one end of the axis and rotate the wheel, more of the 
scaling is applied to the other end.
Panning
After zooming in on a region of interest, you may want to view data that is just off screen. To do this, press Option 
(Macintosh) or Alt (Windows) and move the mouse to the graph interior where the cursor changes to a hand. Now 
drag the body of the graph. Pressing Shift will constrain movement to the horizontal or vertical directions.
This operation is undoable.
Fling Mode
If, while panning, you release the mouse button while the mouse is still moving, the panning will automat-
ically continue. While panning, release the Option or Alt key and change the force or direction of the mouse-
click gesture to change the panning speed or direction. Click the mouse button once to stop.
Panning Using the Mouse Wheel
You can pan a graph using the mouse wheel. Start by positioning the mouse over the axis until the cursor 
changes to a double-ended arrow.
Press the shift key and rotate the wheel. The axis range is changed to pan the graph. The axis value over 
which you position the mouse remains fixed while the axis range is changed.
Panning is triggered by "horizontal scrolling" with the mouse wheel. With most mice, you trigger horizon-
tally scrolling by pressing the shift key and rotating the scroll wheel, but some mice may behave differently.
Setting the Range of an Axis
You can set the range and other scaling parameters for individual axes using the Axis Range tab in the 
Modify Axis dialog. You can display the dialog with this tab selected by choosing Set Axis Range from the
