Markers
If you choose the Markers or Lines and Markers mode you also can choose the marker, marker size, marker 
thickness, and whether the marker is transparent or filled with color. The marker size is a fractional number 
from 0 to 200. 0 means “auto”, which chooses a marker size appropriate to the size of the graph. The marker 
thickness is in a fractional number from 0 to 50 points. Fractional points may not be evident on screen but 
can be seen in exported and printed graphics. Setting the marker thickness to 0 makes the markers disap-
pear.
There is an interaction between marker size and marker thickness: Igor will adjust the marker size if this is 
needed to make the marker symmetrical. The unadjusted width and height of the marker is 2*s+1 points 
where s is the marker size setting.
Here is a table of the markers and the corresponding marker codes:
