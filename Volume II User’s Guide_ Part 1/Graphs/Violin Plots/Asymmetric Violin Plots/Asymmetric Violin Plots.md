Asymmetric Violin Plots
A common variation on a standard violin plot uses just half the violin. This is usually done to compare two 
conditions or two runs. One condition provides the left half and the other provides the right half.
Let's make the plot above into an asymmetric plot.
The first step is to right-click one of the traces in the plot and choose Modify Violin Plot from the contextual 
menu. Select the trace that you want for the left half, say the Run1 trace. On the General tab, find the Plot 
Side menu and select Left Side. Select Run2 and select Right Side in the Plot Side menu. Click Do It and you 
now have a plot that looks like this:
Because the X axis is a category axis, each plot occupies its own slot in the category. To bring them together, 
double-click the Run1 trace to bring up the Modify Trace Appearance dialog. Make sure the first trace in 
the trace list is selected. In the Grouping menu, select Keep With Next. We also made the graph window 
narrower for aesthetic reasons:
