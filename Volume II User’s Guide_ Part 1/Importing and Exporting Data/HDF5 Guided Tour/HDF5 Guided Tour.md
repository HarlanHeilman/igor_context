HDF5 in Igor Pro
HDF5 is a widely-used, very flexible data file format. The HDF5 file format is a creation of the National 
Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). HDF5 is now supported by The HDF Group 
(http://www.hdfgroup.org).
Igor Pro includes deep support for HDF5, including:
•
Browsing HDF5 files
•
Loading data from HDF5 files
•
Saving data to HDF5 files
•
Saving Igor experiments as HDF5 files
•
Loading Igor experiments from HDF5 files
Prior to Igor Pro 9.00, HDF5 support was provided by an XOP that you had to activate. HDF5 support is 
now built into Igor and activation is no longer required.
Support for saving and loading Igor experiments as HDF5 files was added in Igor Pro 9.00. For details see 
HDF5 Packed Experiment Files on page II-223.
