# Legends in the Layout Layer

Chapter II-18 — Page Layouts
II-495
Using the top-left anchor, a (0, 0) XY offset would put a tag in the top-left corner of the page:
Textbox/A=LT/X=0/Y=0 "Test 1"
An XY offset of (50, 50) would put a tag in the middle of the page.
Textbox/A=LT/X=50/Y=50 "Test 2"
Using the middle-center anchor, a (0, 0) XY offset would put a tag in the middle of the page:
Textbox/A=MC/X=0/Y=0 "Test 3"
An XY offset of (-50, 50) would put a tag in the top-left corner of the page.
Textbox/A=MC/X=-50/Y=50 "Test 4"
For most purposes, the left-top anchor is the easiest to use and is sufficient.
The anchor sets not only the reference point on the page but also the reference point on the annotation. For 
example, if the anchor is right-top then the XY offset sets the position of the right-top corner of the annota-
tion, relative to the right-top corner of the page. For this reason, if you want several textboxes to be right-
aligned, you would want to use a right-top, right-center or right-bottom anchor.
Legends in the Layout Layer
When you invoke the Add Annotations dialog and choose Legend, Igor automatically sets the annotation’s 
text to produce a legend containing a symbol for each wave in each graph object in the layout. This diagram 
illustrates the legend text generated by the dialog:
Left-top
Middle-top
Right-top
Left-center
Middle-center
Right-center
Left-bottom
Middle-bottom
Right-bottom
