Page Layout Subwindows
The subwindow is a power-user feature. It is described in detail in Chapter III-4, Embedding and Subwin-
dows and can not be effectively used without a careful reading of that chapter. In this section we discuss 
subwindows as they apply to page layouts.
You can create three kinds of subwindows in a page layout window: graphs, tables, and 3D Gizmo plots. 
To add a subwindow to a layout:
1.
Activate the layout layer by clicking the layout icon.
2.
Select the marquee tool (dashed-line rectangle).
3.
Drag out a marquee.
4.
Click inside the marquee and choose one of the following:
•
New Graph Here
•
New Category Plot Here
•
New Contour Plot Here
•
New Image Plot Here
•
New Table Here
•
New 3D Plot Here
You can also create a subwindow by right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking (Macintosh) while in 
drawing mode and choosing an item from the New submenu.
You can convert a layout object to an embedded subwindow by right-clicking (Windows) or Control-clicking 
(Macintosh) while in layout mode and choosing Convert To Embedded. Note that a graph containing a 
control panel or controls cannot be converted into an embedded graph, even though a graph object with 
controls or control panels can be added to a layout. Such a graph object does not display the controls or 
control panels, however.
You can convert a subwindow to a standalone window and layout object object by right-clicking (Windows) 
or Control-clicking (Macintosh) while in layout mode and choosing Convert To Window And Object. In a 
graph window, you must click in the graph background, away from any traces or axes.
Page Layout Drawing
Like graphs and control panels, you can add drawing elements to page layouts. Drawing in general is dis-
cussed under Chapter III-3, Drawing. This section discusses drawing issues specific to page layouts.
You enter drawing mode by clicking the second icon from the top in the tool palette, as explained under 
Activating the Current Drawing Layer on page II-480. Once in drawing mode, you can select a specific 
drawing layer using the drawing layer tool, as explained under Changing the Current Drawing Layer on 
page II-480.
Page Layout Slide Shows
A layout slide show is a full-screen display of the pages in a layout, suitable for a presentation to a group. 
You start a slide shows by clicking the button at the bottom/right corner of the layout page sorter, or using 
the LayoutSlideShow operation.
Using the Slide Show Settings dialog, which you can invoke via the Layout menu, you can control various 
aspects of the slide show, including:
•
How pages are scaled to fit the screen
•
How multiple monitors are used
•
The time to wait before showing the next slide
