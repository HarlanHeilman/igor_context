Chapter II-18 — Page Layouts
II-476
Overview
A page layout, or layout for short, is a type of window that you can use to compose pages containing:
•
Graphs
•
Tables
•
3D Gizmo plots
•
Annotations (textboxes and legends)
•
Pictures
•
Drawing elements (lines, arrows, rectangles, polygons, etc.)
You create a layout by choosing New Layout from the Windows menu.
When the active window is a page layout window, the Layout menu appears in the menu bar. It contains 
items that apply to page layout windows only.
You can use a page layout to make complex graphics for publication and slide shows for presentation. A 
layout can have multiple pages. You can have as many layouts as memory allows.
Each page layout page has a number of layers. One layer, the layout layer, is for graphs, tables, 3D Gizmo 
plots, annotations and pictures. The other layers are for drawing elements. Drawing is discussed in detail 
in Chapter III-3, Drawing. This chapter is primarily devoted to the layout layer.
Here are the notable features of page layouts:
•
You can combine graphs, tables, 3D Gizmo plots, pictures, annotations and drawing elements.
•
Graphs, tables, Gizmo plots and legends in layouts are updated automatically.
•
Layouts can contain multiple pages.
•
You can export all or part of a layout page to another program as a graphics file.
•
You can use a layout to create a full-screen slide show.
There are two ways to add a graph, table or Gizmo plot to a page layout:
•
By creating a layout object in the layout layer. A layout object represents the contents of a standalone 
graph window, table window, or 3D Gizmo plot window. Layout objects are described under Page 
Layout Objects on page II-485.
•
By creating an graph, table or Gizmo subwindow in a drawing layer. Subwindows are described 
under Page Layout Subwindows on page II-497.
The subwindow is a power-user feature. It is described in detail in Chapter III-4, Embedding and Subwin-
dows. Graph, table and Gizmo objects are less powerful but simpler to use and more intuitive. We recom-
mend using objects until you have had time to read and understand Chapter III-4.
In this chapter, the term “object” refers to a graph, table, 3D Gizmo plot, annotation or picture object, not to 
a subwindow.
The following documentation discusses page layouts from the top down, covering these objects:
•
Windows
•
Pages
•
Layers
•
Layout objects (in the layout layer)
•
Drawing elements (in the drawing layers)
•
Subwindows (in the drawing layers)
