Activating the Current Drawing Layer
When you click the drawing mode icon, the current drawing layer is activated. You can use the drawing 
tools to add elements to or modify elements in the current drawing layer only.
Changing the Current Drawing Layer
Initially, the UserFront drawing layer will be the current drawing layer. To select a different drawing layer, 
click the layer tool and select the layer from the pop-up menu.
You may never need to use the drawing layer pop-up menu. Most users will need to use just the layout layer 
and the UserFront drawing layer. The ProgFront and ProgBack layers are intended to be used from Igor 
procedures only.
When the layout icon is highlighted, the layout layer 
and layout tools are activated.
