If you click an element that is not in the active layer, Igor ignores the click.
The Layout Layer Tool Palette
When you click the top icon in the tool palette, Igor displays the tools for the layout layer.
Arrow Tool
When you click the arrow tool, it becomes highlighted. The arrow tool is used 
to select, move or resize a graph, table, annotation or picture object. To select 
an object, click it. Adjustment handles appear on the selected object.
When you position the cursor over an object, the info panel shows the name of 
the object under the cursor. If you click and drag, the object will follow the 
cursor as you drag it. While you drag, the info panel shows the left and top 
coordinates of the object as well as its width and height. If you press Shift while 
dragging an object, the direction of movement is constrained either horizon-
tally, vertically, or diagonally, depending on the motion direction. You must 
press Shift after clicking the object - otherwise the Shift-click will deselect it.
If you press Shift while dragging an object, the direction of movement is constrained either horizontally or 
vertically, depending on the first motion direction.
You can set the object’s width and height by dragging the selected object’s handles. While you drag, the info 
panel shows the width and height of the object.
When you adjust the size of a table and then release the mouse, the table is auto-sized to an appropriate 
integral number of rows and columns.
You can quickly force an annotation or picture back to its unadjusted size (100% by 100%) by pressing Option 
(Macintosh) or Alt (Windows) and double-clicking the object.
Double-clicking an object while the arrow tool is selected brings up the Modify Objects dialog, described in 
Modifying Layout Objects on page II-487. Use this dialog to set the object’s properties.
To select multiple objects, click to select the first object and Shift-click to select other objects. Alternatively, 
you can click in the page and drag diagonally. If you Shift-click an object that is already selected, it becomes 
deselected.
When two or more objects are selected, you can align them using the Align submenu in the Layout menu. 
You can also make the widths, heights, or widths and heights of the selected objects the same using items 
in the Layout menu. In all of these actions, the first object that you select is used as the basis for aligning or 
resizing other objects. Click in a blank area of the page to deselect all objects. Then click the object whose 
position or size you want to replicate. Now Shift-click to select additional objects. Finally, choose the 
desired action from the Layout menu.
While an object is selected, you can control its front-to-back ordering in the layout layer by choosing Bring 
to Front, Move Forward, Send to Back or Move Backward from the Layout menu. This changes the order 
of objects within the layout layer only. It has no effect on the drawing layers.
If you select a graph, table or 3D Gizmo object, you can then double-click the name of the object in the info 
panel at the bottom of the layout window. This activates the associated graph or table window.
With multiple objects selected, you can perform the following actions:
•
Delete the objects, using the Delete key or the EditClear menu item.
•
Copy the objects, using EditCopy.
•
Cut the objects, using EditCut.
•
Drag the objects to a new location.
