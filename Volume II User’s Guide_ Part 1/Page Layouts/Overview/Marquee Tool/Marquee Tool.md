Marquee Tool
When you click the marquee tool, it becomes highlighted and the cursor changes to a crosshair. You can use the 
marquee tool to identify multiple objects for cutting, copying, clearing or arranging. You can also use it to indi-
cate a part of the layout for export to another application and to control pasting of objects from the clipboard.
To use the marquee tool, click the mouse and drag it diagonally to indicate the region of interest. Igor dis-
plays a dashed outline around the region. This outline is called a marquee. A marquee has handles and 
edges that allow you to refine its size and position.
To refine the size of the marquee, move the cursor over one of the handles. The cursor changes to a double 
arrow which shows you the direction in which the handle adjusts the edge of the marquee. To adjust the 
edge, simply drag it to a new position.
To refine the position of the marquee, move the cursor over one of the edges away from the handles. The 
cursor changes to a hand. To move the marquee, drag it.
To make it possible to export any section of a layout, an object is considered selected if it intersects the mar-
quee. This is in contrast to selection with the arrow tool, which requires that you completely enclose the object.
This table shows how to use the marquee.
When you click inside the marquee Igor presents a pop-up menu, called the Layout Marquee menu, from 
which you can choose Cut, Copy, Paste, or Clear. This cuts, copies, pastes or clears the all objects that inter-
sect the marquee. These marquee items do the same thing as the corresponding items in the Edit menu.
The Marquee menu also contains items that allow you to insert a subwindow.
It is possible to add your own menu items to the Layout Marquee menu. See Marquee Menus on page 
IV-137 for details.
See Copying Objects from the Layout Layer on page II-493 and Pasting Objects into the Layout Layer on 
page II-493 for more details on copying and pasting. See Arranging Layout Objects on page II-487 for 
details on tiling and stacking.
When the marquee tool is selected, any selected object is deselected. Double-clicking while the marquee tool 
is selected has no effect.
