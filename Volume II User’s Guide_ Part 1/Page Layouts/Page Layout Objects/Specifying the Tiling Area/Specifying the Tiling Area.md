# Specifying the Tiling Area

Chapter II-18 — Page Layouts
II-489
Drag the top/left graph down until its top edge is at 72 points (as displayed in the T section of the 
layout status panel)
Shift-click to select the top/right graph also and choose LayoutAlignTop Edges.
Shift-click to select the bottom/right graph also.
Choose LayoutArrange Objects.
Check the Use Bounding Box checkbox.
Click Do It.
Now Igor has tiled the objects into the bounding box surrounding the selected graph objects. The 
bounding box is the smallest rectangle that encompasses all of the objects to be tiled.
We have left the top 72 points of the layout open for use by textboxes or other objects.
Next we will see how to do the same thing but using the marquee instead of the bounding box and 
leaving 36 points instead of 72 points of free space at the top.
The marquee tool is a dashed rectangle. It appears below the arrow tool and above the Annotation 
tool in the page layout tool palette.
To drag out a marquee, click in the page and drag diagonally. The marquee coordinates are displayed 
in the layout status panel at the bottom of the layout window.
The marquee has draggable handles on the corners and in the middle of each side that you can use 
for fine tuning its position.

Click the Marquee tool and drag out a marquee that roughly fills the entire page.
Position the mouse over the top handle and drag it so that the top is positioned at 36 points as 
shown in the T section of the layout status panel.
Drag the left, bottom, and right marquee handles to the corresponding page edges.
Choose LayoutArrange Objects.
Uncheck the Use Bounding Box checkbox to enable the Use Marquee checkbox.
Click Do It.
Now Igor has tiled the objects into the area specified by the marquee.
This concludes the layout tiling guided tour.
Selecting Tiling Objects
There are several ways to specify which objects to arrange. The easiest is to select the objects in the page 
layout before summoning the Arrange Objects dialog. The selected objects will then be selected in the 
Objects to Arrange list.
Alternatively, you can select objects in the list directly. Objects are tiled in the order in which you select 
them.
Finally you can include objects to be tiled using the various dialog checkboxes such as All Graphs Too and 
All Tables Too.
If you select no objects in the list and select none of the checkboxes, then all of the objects in the layout will 
be arranged.
Specifying the Tiling Area
You can specify the tiling area by clicking the marquee tool and dragging out a marquee. Then when you 
enter the dialog, the Use Marquee checkbox will be checked and enabled.
Alternatively, you can pre-position the objects so that their bounding box defines the tiling area. The bound-
ing box is the smallest rectangle that completely encloses all of the objects to be tiled. To use this technique, 
roughly pre-position the objects. Next precisely adjust the positions of the left-most, top-most, right-most,
