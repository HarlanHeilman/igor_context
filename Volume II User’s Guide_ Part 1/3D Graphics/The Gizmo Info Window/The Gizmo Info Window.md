The Gizmo Info Window
The Gizmo info window is the main user interface for controlling the display of objects in the Gizmo display 
window. Each info window has an associated Gizmo display window that shows the resulting graphical 
plot.
The info window contains three lists: the display list, the object list, and the attribute list. You use these lists 
to add objects and to modify their appearance in the Gizmo display window. Only items that appear in the 
display list are actually drawn in the Gizmo display window.
You can create objects using the + icon at the bottom of the object list. Clicking the + icon displays a menu 
from which you choose the type of object to add. The + icon below the attribute list adds attributes while 
the + icon below the display list adds operations.
The object list contains only objects and the attribute list contains only attributes. The display list can 
contain objects dragged in from the object list, attributes dragged in from the attribute list, and operations.
You can edit an item's properties by double-clicking its icon or by selecting it and clicking the gear icon 
below the list. You can remove an item from a list by selecting it and pressing the delete key or by clicking 
the - icon.
