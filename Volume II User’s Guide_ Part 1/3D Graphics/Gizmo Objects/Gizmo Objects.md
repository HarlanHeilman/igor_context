Gizmo Objects
There are five main categories of Gizmo objects: wave-based objects, axis objects, drawing primitive objects, 
lights, and miscellaneous objects.
Wave-based Gizmo objects, also called "data objects", get their data from waves and include the following 
types:
•
Path Plots
•
Ribbon Plots
•
Surface Plots
•
Isosurface Plots
•
Voxelgram Plots
•
3D Scatter Plots
•
3D Bar Plots
•
Gizmo Image Plots
Axis object types include:
•
Axis Objects
•
Axis Cue Objects
Drawing primitive object types include:
•
Line Objects
•
Triangle Objects
•
Quad Objects
•
Box Objects
•
Sphere Objects
•
Cylinder Objects
•
Disk Objects
•
Tetrahedron Objects
•
Pie Wedge Objects
There is only one light object type:
•

Miscellaneous object types include:
•
Group Objects
•
Texture Objects
•
Matrix4x4 Objects
You create an object by clicking the + icon below the object list in the info window for a given Gizmo display 
window.
An object of a given type has a set of internal properties that you can edit when you first create the object. 
You can edit them later by double-clicking the object in the object or display lists.
Creating a Gizmo object puts it in the object list. It is not displayed until you drag it to the display list. You 
can drag a given object to the display list multiple times. This creates an new display object each time.
