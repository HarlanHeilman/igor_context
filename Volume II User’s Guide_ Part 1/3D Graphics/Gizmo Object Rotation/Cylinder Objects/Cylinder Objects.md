You can create other geometric shapes by increasing the number of stacks and keeping slices=2.
Cylinder Objects
A cylinder is a quadric object, meaning that it can be generated by a quadratic polynomial. Cylinders are 
constructed from slices and rings. Specifying more slices creates a smoother cylinder. Initially, the cylinder 
axis is centered on the Z axis, height is in the positive Z direction, and the cylinder base is in the XY-plane.
Create conical objects (see illustration below) by specifying different values for the base radius and top 
radius parameters.
By default, cylinders are initially drawn filled. The fill color is determined by the internal color attribute, an 
embedded color attribute, or a global color attribute, in that order of precedence.
Use translate and rotate operations to position the cylinder in other locations and orientations.
These commands generate a cylinder with baseRadius=1, topRadius=1, height=1, slices=25, and rings=5 and 
set its drawing style to lines:
AppendToGizmo/D cylinder = {1,1,1,25,5}
ModifyGizmo modifyObject=cylinder0, objectType=Cylinder, 
property={useGlobalAttributes,0}
ModifyGizmo modifyObject=cylinder0, objectType=Cylinder, 
property={drawStyle,100011}
