# Disk Objects

Chapter II-17 — 3D Graphics
II-443
A cone created using the same command but with topRadius=0:
AppendToGizmo/D cylinder = {1,0,1,25,5}, name=cone0
ModifyGizmo modifyObject=cone0, objectType=Cylinder, 
property={useGlobalAttributes,0}
ModifyGizmo modifyObject=cone0, objectType=Cylinder, 
property={drawStyle,100011}
You can create other types of cylindrical object shapes by specifying a small number for slices. Create a tri-
angular cylinder with slices = 3; create a square cylinder or open-ended box with slices = 4. Use different 
values for baseRadius or topRadius to create pyramid shapes.
Disk Objects
A disk is a quadric object, meaning that it can be generated by a quadratic polynomial. The disk is initially 
located in the XY plane centered on the origin. Create a smoother disk by specifying a greater number for 
slices.
By default, disks are initially drawn filled. The fill color is determined by the internal color attribute, an 
embedded color attribute, or a global color attribute, in that order of precedence.
