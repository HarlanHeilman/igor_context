# 3D Bar Plots

Chapter II-17 — 3D Graphics

The full list of available options is given under ModifyGizmo.
You can display crystal structures in Gizmo using scatter plots. Here is an example:
Crystals are easy to display as scatter objects that are centered at coordinates provided in a triplet wave. For 
example, you can use a sphere as the object drawn at each center. You can specify additional waves to 
control the color and size of each sphere.
Igor provides two built-in transformations that convert triplet waves from crystallography coordinates to 
rectangular coordinates and vice versa. See the Crystal Demo experiment and the WaveTransform opera-
tion with the keywords crystalToRect and rectToCrystal.
3D Bar Plots
A 3D bar plot consists of a number of straight (parallel to all three axes) rectangular bars. The bars may be 
arranged on a regular grid or may be completely scattered within the volume.
There are two modes for 3D bar plots: basic and refined.
