Isosurface Plots
An isosurface is a 3D analog of 2D contour line. It is a surface drawn at the specified scalar value called the 
"isovalue". The surface may be represented by any combination of colors, grids, or points.
Here is an example of a translucent isosurface:
Isosurface generation is computationally intensive because it subdivides the volume into tetrahedra. If the 
isovalue is found in any tetrahedron, the intersection (one or two triangles) is calculated. The isosurface 
itself is composed of the collections of these triangles.
Isosurfaces are constructed from 3D volumetric data waves. 
The full list of available options is given under ModifyGizmo.
Printing Gizmo Windows
You can print the image in the Gizmo display window by choosing FilePrint when the Gizmo display 
window is the front window.
