# Dialog Wave Browser

Chapter II-11 — Dialog Features
II-228
Overview
Most Igor Pro dialogs are designed with common features. This chapter describes some of those common 
features.
Operation Dialogs
Menus and dialogs provide easy access to many of Igor Pro’s operations.
When you choose a menu item, like Data-Make waves, Igor presents a dialog:
As you click and type in the items in the dialog, Igor generates an appropriate command. The command 
being generated is displayed in the command box near the bottom of the dialog.
As you become more proficient, you will find that some commands are easier to invoke from a dialog and 
others are easier to enter directly in the command line. There are some menus and dialogs that bypass the 
command line, usually because they perform functions that have no command line equivalents.
Dialog Wave Browser
In dialogs in which a wave must be selected, Igor presents a list of suitable waves in a dialog wave browser. 
The browser also lets you navigate through the data folder hierarchy.
Double-click a data folder icon to make that data folder the top level for the hierarchical display. To return 
to levels closer to the root, use the menu at the top of the browser.
In dialogs that support selection of multiple items, you can drag the mouse over items to select more than 
one. Press Shift while clicking to add additional contiguous items to a selection. Press Command (Macin-
tosh) or Ctrl (Windows) while clicking to add additional discontiguous items to a selection.
You can change the columns that are displayed in the browser by right-clicking the header and enabling or 
disabling the different columns. If you click on a column in the header area, the waves in the browser are 
sorted by that column. Click the column in the header area again to reverse the sort direction.
After toggling the display of one or more columns, you may wish to right-click the header again and choose 
Size All Columns to Fit. You can also resize the columns by dragging the vertical bar that separates col-
umns.
Click the gear icon at the bottom of the browser to display the options menu. It allows you to control 
whether data folders are displayed and how the waves are sorted and grouped.
