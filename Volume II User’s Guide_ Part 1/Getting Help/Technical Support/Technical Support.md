Example Experiments
Igor Pro comes with a large collection of examples which demonstrate Igor features and techniques. You 
can access them using the FileExample Experiments submenu.
Igor Mailing List
The Igor mailing list is an Internet discussion list that provides a way for Igor Pro users to help one another 
and to share solutions and ideas. WaveMetrics also uses the list to post information on the latest Igor devel-
opments. For information about subscribing and other details about the mailing list, please visit this web page:
http://www.wavemetrics.com/users/mailinglist.htm
IgorExchange
IgorExchange is a user-to-user support and collaboration web site sponsored by WaveMetrics but run by 
and for Igor users. For information about IgorExchange, please visit this web page:

Updating Igor
WaveMetrics periodically releases free updates for Igor. Updates provide bug fixes and sometimes new fea-
tures.
Igor Pro checks for available updates during startup by contacting one of our web sites. This update check 
is implemented to minimize any performance impact on starting Igor.
If an update is found, Igor presents a dialog in which you can choose to download the update, skip notifi-
cations about the current update, or be reminded later about the update. You can also choose to view the 
release notes for the update.
You can disable automatic update checking using the Updates section of the Miscellaneous Settings dialog. 
You can also enable checking for beta versions.
You can manually check for updates at any time by choosing HelpUpdates for Igor Pro. This works 
regardless of whether automatic update checking is enabled.
If your Internet access requires a proxy server or other unusual configuration, Igor's update checking mech-
anism may fail. In those cases you can always go to http://www.wavemetrics.net to see if an update is avail-
able.
Technical Support
WaveMetrics provides technical support via email.
To send an email to WaveMetrics support, start by choosing HelpContact Support. This creates an email 
containing information about your Igor installation, such as your Igor serial number and the Igor version, 
which we need to provide support.
In most cases, we need to reproduce your problem in order to solve it. It is best if you can provide a simpli-
fied example showing the problem.
